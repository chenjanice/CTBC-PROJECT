* This file contains the first step of our project:
  1. We look at Bill Ackman's portfolio on Dataroma
  2. We then crawl his weights.
  3. We find the price of the stock which he invest.
* After that, we run regression of Bill Ackman's portfolio on fama-french 5 factor model.
* We decide to include all investors on dataroma. There are 65 investors.
* We find 15xx stock prices and 65 weights, running 65 regressions.
* We start to construct our own portfolio. That is, we want to find weights in S&P500 stocks.
* 因為想看Stephan Mandell，又是投科技股，所以改成都看科技股，加入NASDQ return
