"        Activist investors are set to capitalize on the market turmoil, so here's a way to track them
			                 ",2020,04,18," From 2007 through 2019, I wrote the weekly Activist Spotlight column at Barron's. I have now joined the CNBC team and will be writing the weekly update exclusively for CNBC readers. Due to the coronavirus crisis we have delayed the launch of this column, but we believe now is the right time to start focusing on company fundamentals and catalysts.Shareholder activists like Bill Ackman are value investors who identify cheap companies and create their own catalysts to close the valuation gaps. With activist stocks, you do not necessarily have to wait for the market to recognize the value in a company — the activist agenda, if implemented correctly, should close the valuation gap.For several reasons, shareholder activism tends to flourish after market sell-offs and in down and flat environments.So, we will be providing interesting activist opportunities and discussing timely topics regarding shareholder activism and corporate governance in the new column.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/18/activist-investors-are-set-to-capitalize-on-the-market-turmoil-so-heres-a-way-to-track-them.html

Boeing was the best-performing Dow stock, surging 16.4%. —ImbertOil prices fell on Monday amid ongoing uncertainty around the prospect of production cuts. The move lower came even as the CEO of Russian sovereign wealth fund RDIF told CNBC that Moscow and Riyadh were ""very close"" to an oil deal, and as Russia reportedly said it was ready to reduce output, according to Reuters.U.S. West Texas Intermediate fell 7.97% to settle at $26.08 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent crude dipped 3.1% to settle at $33.05 per barrel. Earlier, WTI fell more than 10% after a meeting between OPEC and its allies, initially scheduled for Monday, was delayed. The meeting will now ""likely"" take place on Thursday, according to sources familiar with the matter.But even if a deal is reached, many argue that prices will stay lower for longer due to the unprecedented demand destruction caused by the coronavirus. In other words, the supply side is a secondary story to the demand hit.""Be prepared for another drop in oil prices soon, when market participants realize that the real issue they have to deal with is the declining demand oil demand, for which the proposed cuts, even if realized, are set to fail to bridge the gap,"" said Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil markets at Rystad Energy. — StevensAbout 12 stocks rose at the New York Stock Exchange on Monday for every decliner as the market rallied on hopes the rate of new coronavirus cases is starting to ebb.

With Carnival's market cap of roughly $6.8 billion, Saudi Arabia's stake is worth about $558 million. — PoundSigns are emerging that the worst of coronavirus crisis may be behind us, according to Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat. He cited a drop in hospitalizations and deaths in New York state, better-than-expected healthcare resource utilization as well as a sustained improvement in Italy and Spain. The positive developments are prompting investors to transition to a more optimistic or ""half-full"" view on the markets, Lee said. ""Market is shifting to a half-full perspective, as cases peak,"" said Lee in a note to clients. ""Incoming data suggests NY state might peak sooner than Cuomo's optimistic case...With better visibility on the healthcare crisis in the US, particularly, on a potential to model a national peak, we believe buyers are now taking control."" Lee believes the downside in stocks is limited from here because of the quick response from policymakers as well as the nature of the pandemic cycle. — LiFormer Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen thinks the central bank is not in a position where it needs to buy equities but thinks lawmakers should give them more leeway for the future. ""I frankly don't think it's necessary at this point. I think intervention to support the credit markets is more important, but longer term it wouldn't be a bad thing for Congress to reconsider the powers that the Fed has with respect to assets it can own,"" Yellen told CNBC's Sara Eisen on ""Squawk on the Street."" Other central banks — including the Bank of Japan — have been purchasing some of their countries' stocks to mitigate the recent carnage sparked by the coronavirus outbreak. — Imbert With the majority of Americans staying at home amid the coronavirus outbreak, demand for gasoline has plummeted.

If it was, she said, the unemployment rate probably would be as high as 13% while the overall economic contraction is about 30%. ""If we had a timely unemployment statistic, the unemployment rate probably would be up to 12 or 13% at this point and moving higher,"" Yellen told CNBC's Sara Eisen during a ""Squawk on the Street"" interview. — CoxStocks in the battered travel sector have notched strong gains in early trading as investors react to improving health data from Europe and New York City, signaling that lockdowns and shelter-in-place orders may be lifted sooner than feared.

"        Bill Ackman says accusations he tried to drive down market in interview are 'absurd'
			                 ",2020,03,27," Pershing Square Capital manager Bill Ackman defended his emotional CNBC appearance last week after his fund announced a few days later that it made more than $2 billion on bets against the markets. The investor warned in the interview that ""hell is coming"" and that hotel stocks could go to zero.""Shortly after the show, I heard that some had interpreted my remarks as being very bearish on the market,"" Ackman told investors on Thursday. ""The idea that my appearance pushed the market down an additional 4% that day is absurd.""""Yes, I got somewhat emotional as I talked about protecting my immune-compromised father from the ravages of the virus. But, I had become bullish because of my belief that the entire country would soon go into lockdown, and that would be the fastest and best way to minimize the impact of the virus,"" he added.The billionaire investor had urged President Donald Trump on March 18 on Twitter to seal off the U.S. from the rest of the world ""for the next 30 days"" to protect the American population from further coronavirus destruction before joining CNBC's Scott Wapner later that day.At that time, Ackman warned that hotel operator Hilton Worldwide was ""going to zero ... along with every other hotel company in the world,"" said that America could ""end as we know it"" and cautioned U.S. companies to stop their stock buyback programs because ""hell is coming.""The impassioned interview sparked controversy, however, as other investors argued that Pershing would profit from further market declines thanks to a series of prescient bets made in February. Ackman disclosed on March 3 that he'd purchased a variety of credit default swaps on investment-grade and high-yield indexes, essentially purchasing insurance on credit which would increase in value as the underlying assets deteriorated and spreads widened.Ackman explained on March 3 that he'd purchased the default swaps as hedges against the market if efforts to contain the novel coronavirus had a ""substantial negative impact on the U.S. and global economies"" as he thought likely. But some argued that his appearance March 18 on CNBC was intended to sow further fear and increase the value of the swaps.""A number of press reports have raised questions about my appearance on CNBC last Wednesday, and some have even questioned whether my appearance was intended to drive down the market so that we could profit on hedges we had previously entered into,"" Ackman wrote in the letter.But Ackman reiterated that he had said in the interview on March 18 that he had already started adding to Pershing's existing stock holdings since equities looked cheap amid the historic market sell-off.""I've been aggressively buying stocks including Hilton today. And I've been buying all the way down — Hilton, Restaurant Brands and Starbucks,"" Ackman said on March 18.He added on Thursday that, contrary to the opinion held by those including ex-hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz that the interview was panic-inducing, his bullishness was evident in his purchases.""My bullish posture and my statements on CNBC and Twitter were strongly supportive of the markets. I made those statements at the time we were buying stocks and reducing our short in the credit markets,"" Ackman wrote Thursday.Ackman said in his letter that his hedge had already paid off prior to his appearance on CNBC and that Pershing had sold most, but not all, of the hedge prior to his interview with Wapner.""In fact, if you believe we move markets – a highly dubious assertion – one could argue that had I not told the world that we were bullish and were buying stocks, both equity and credit markets would have declined even more than they did, and we would have made more money on the hedges,"" Ackman wrote.Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/27/bill-ackman-says-his-cnbc-interview-was-bullish-denies-harming-market.html
"        Bill Ackman warned 'hell is coming' because of virus: He then pocketed $2B in bets against markets
			                 ",2020,03,25," Pershing Square manager Bill Ackman turned a net profit of more than $2 billion on Monday after he sold his bets against the market less than one week after warning CNBC that ""hell is coming"" and imploring the White House to shut down the country for a monthHe then used those proceeds to wager that existing Pershing bets, including hotel operator Hilton Worldwide, would rebound. Ackman said the fund completed the exit from his bets against the market on March 23 and generated $2.6 billion compared with premiums paid and commissions totaling $27 million. The amount of capital Ackman put behind protecting credit — the actual principal wagered against the market — is unknown.Still, the Ackman about-face came less than one week after he told CNBC's Scott Wapner in an emotional interview that the United States was in jeopardy unless President Donald Trump closed the country for one month in a sort-of ""Spring Break.""""America will end as we know it. I'm sorry to say so, unless we take this option,"" he told CNBC on March 18, five days before ending his bet against the market. ""We need to shut it down now. ... This is the only answer.""That Ackman added to his Hilton position using the money he earned from his bets against the market is notable, especially given the grim forecast he issued for equity last week. He first announced his hedges against the market on March 3.""It's going to zero along with every other hotel company in the world. ... Every hotel is going to be shut down in the country. Every one,"" he said at the time. ""Again, I'm a major shareholder. [But] if we allow this to continue the way we allow it to continue, every hotel company in the world is done.""Though some, like ex-hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, blamed Ackman for stoking the market's panic, the Pershing Square manager said in his Wednesday letter that the outlook for equities had changed in a material way over five days.""The federal government and the U.S. Treasury have intervened in financial markets in an unprecedented fashion, and the Congress is on the brink of passing legislation which will help bridge the economy and our country's workforce and citizens during what we believe to be a temporary but massive economic shock,"" Ackman wrote.For those reasons, ""we became increasingly positive on equity and credit markets last week, and began the process of unwinding our hedges and redeploying our capital in companies we love at bargain prices,"" he added.Ackman said he used the influx of cash to add to Pershing's existing investments in Agilent, Berkshire Hathaway, Hilton, Lowe's and Restaurant Brands. The fund also purchased ""several new investments including reestablishing our investment in Starbucks,"" which it had closed in January.The billionaire investor explained that Pershing's market hedges included credit protection on various investment-grade and high-yield credit indexes. Ackman said that since Pershing was able to purchase the hedges at near-all-time tight levels of credit spreads, the risk of loss was ""minimal.""That bet proved prescient ahead of one of the worst market sell-offs in the modern era as the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 30% through Friday from their recent highs as the coronavirus and measures to contain its spread worried economists that the U.S. economy is headed toward a recession.The spike in volatility and steep equity losses have in turn forced the Federal Reserve to embark on a host of massive easing programs to help calm stressed credit markets. The central bank announced Monday that it will purchase corporate bonds and not just U.S. Treasurys, providing unprecedented support for investment-grade corporate debt.But for Ackman, the coronavirus remains a calamitous problem that he thinks will continue until the U.S. government locks down the country for one month. ""We believe that the federal government will soon initiate a total-US shutdown with a defined reopening date about 30 days later,"" Ackman wrote Wednesday. ""If the federal government does not impose such a lockdown, we believe it is likely that effectively all fifty states will do so eventually, with the additional delay costing many thousands of more lives, and much greater economic destruction.""Ackman also revealed to CNBC's Scott Wapner he went into lockdown almost a month ago to save the life of his father, who is immuno-compromised.Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/25/bill-ackman-exits-market-hedges-uses-2-billion-he-made-to-buy-more-stocks-including-hilton.html

"        Investor Bill Ackman advises Trump to shut down the country, saying stock market 'will soar'
			                 ",2020,03,18," Longtime hedge fund manager Bill Ackman on Wednesday advised President Donald Trump to shut down the U.S. for one month in an effort to contain the novel coronavirus and said financial markets would rally in response to such decisive action.Ackman, who founded Pershing Square Capital Management, called on the president to both close the nation's borders as well as offer Americans a one-month rent, interest and tax holiday to help offset an expected deceleration in U.S. GDP growth.""Mr. President, the only answer is to shut down the country for the next 30 days and close the borders. Tell all Americans that you are putting us on an extended Spring Break at home with family,"" Ackman wrote on Twitter.""The moment you send everyone home for Spring Break and close the borders, the infection rate will plummet, the stock market will soar, and the clouds will lift,"" he added.Ackman later in the day spoke to CNBC's Scott Wapner and detailed his thoughts further.""Beginning in late January I was getting increasingly bearish and I woke up with a nightmare. And my nightmare was you have this virus that replicates and infects incredibly rapidly,"" he said.Ackman revealed he went into lockdown almost a month ago to save the life of his father, who is immuno-compromised.""You look at the beaches at Fort Lauderdale: Unfortunately, they're packed with 18-to-22-year-olds having the time of their lives, spreading the virus,"" he said.""They're probably OK, most of them ... but when they go home to their parents, or they go home to their loved one, or to their friend who just had breast cancer surgery and is immune-compromised: They're going to kill that person,"" Ackman said.""Everyone feels, you know, '99% chance I'll be OK!'"" he continued. ""But it's not you: It's the person you give it to. I am not going to kill my father, OK?""He also said he urged the companies he's invested in to halt their buyback programs and extend their credit lines because ""hell is coming.""His tweets warned that further delays to such a ""Spring Break"" hiatus would continue to have disastrous costs to human life and pressed Trump to ""please send everyone home now."" ""No one defaults, no one forecloses. A 30-day rent, interest and tax holiday for all,"" he added. ""The shutdown is inevitable as it is already happening, but not in a controlled fashion which is extending the economic pain and amplifying the spread of the virus.""Confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. are now at 6,496 with 114 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, and countries around the world are locking down their borders. Efforts to contain the virus have varied by country with some, like Canada, closing their borders to noncitizens except Americans.The Trump administration is working on a $1 trillion stimulus package to combat the impact of the virus.Ackman, famous on Wall Street for his big bets and proxy campaigns, has in recent years generated sizable returns for Pershing investors with smart bets on stocks like Chipotle and Starbucks. Last year, in particular, was a strong year for the fund with total shareholder returns of more than 50%.But Ackman's investing prowess also helped him get ahead of the market's historic plunge this month. He told investors in early March that he'd taken steps to shore up his investment portfolio to protect against the economic impact of the coronavirus.He said in a letter viewed by CNBC that he put more money toward hedged bets with unusually limited risk of loss thanks to expectations that efforts to contain the coronavirus will dampen growth around the globe.""During the past ten days, we have taken steps to protect the portfolio from downward market volatility. We have done so because we believe that efforts to contain the coronavirus are likely to have a substantial negative impact on the U.S. and global economies, and on equity and credit markets,"" Ackman wrote at the time.The S&P 500 is down at least 15% since Ackman moved more money toward the hedged bets. Pershing had about $8.6 billion in assets under management as of 2019. Subscribe to CNBC PRO for exclusive insights and analysis, and live business day programming from around the world.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/18/bill-ackman-advises-trump-to-shut-down-us-says-market-would-soar.html

Some providers have transitioned almost entirely to virtual consults, and hospitals are offering training sessions for those who aren't yet using telemedicine in their practice. For many of them, including the UC San Francisco cardiologist Ethan Weiss, the experience has been a pleasant surprise. Telemedicine was ""waaaaaaaaay better than I thought,"" he told CNBC. —Christina FarrThe COVID-19 pandemic has crippled Italy and is ricocheting its way around the globe.

I'm sorry to say so, unless we take this option,"" he said. —Yun LiTo prevent millions of Americans from running out of money amid the coronavirus, the government has announced plans to send out checks to them soon. When Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin made the announcement about the cash infusion on Tuesday, universal basic income proponents felt validated. Now, the group of those calling for such a policy, if only in a temporary rendition, is quickly growing. Already some 1 in 2 Americans say they support a program in which the federal government sends out regular checks to everyone, regardless of their earnings or employment. —Annie NovaTesla's North America HR leader Valerie Workman sent an email to employees encouraging them to come work, promising they would not be ""docked"" points in performance reviews if they chose to stay home, and explaining why the Fremont factory and other facilities are up and running amid a COVID-19 pandemic in and beyond California. The email says Tesla has received conflicting guidance from different levels of government amid the pandemic.Tesla is reportedly running its Fremont, California, car plant despite ""shelter in place"" orders initiated across Alameda County (and other counties in the San Francisco Bay Area) to curb the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak. —Lora KolodnyNew York Gov.

It will base payments on income level and family size, according to the document.Beyond direct payments, the government is looking to set aside $50 billion for the ailing airline industry, as well as $150 billion for ""other distressed sectors."" It was not immediately clear which industries would be covered, but the tourism and hotel industries are among those that have also asked the government for relief. —Lauren HirschStocks tumbled as the markets remained highly volatile with the government response to the coronavirus fallout still unfolding.

Many small retailers rely on Amazon to sell their products online, and the hit to sales has caused some to furlough or lay off employees to soften the blow. —Annie PalmerThe National Restaurant Association is asking the federal government for financial relief for the industry as it forecasts sales declines of $225 billion over the next three months.In a letter to President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Major Leader Mitch McConnell, the lobbying group asked for a $145 billion recovery fund from the Treasury Department for the restaurant and food-service industry. Other proposals included federally backed business interruption insurance, tax measures and disaster unemployment insurance. —Amelia LucasNew York Gov.

""I didn't in any way say I think we're going to have that."" —Kevin BreuningerThe International Council of Shopping Centers, which represents America's malls and shopping center owners such as Simon Property Group and Kimco, has sent a letter to the Trump administration seeking aid.

In Europe, BMW announced it has started to shutter its dealerships and plants, which will close by the end of this week. The interruption to the plants is scheduled to run until mid-April, the company said. —Noah Higgins-DunnThe new coronavirus will infect half of the global population and have a fatality rate of up to 3%, analysts said.""We assume that the virus will infect around 50% of the world population; 20% of the cases will be severe, and 1-3% will result in deaths,"" analysts from the Economist Intelligence Unit said in a note.As a result of the pandemic, the EIU predicted global growth would stand at just 1% for 2020 — down from its outlook of 2.3% before the outbreak began. It would mark the lowest rate in global gross domestic product growth since the global financial crisis, analysts noted. —Chloe TaylorThe new coronavirus can survive for several hours in air particles and last days on surfaces, according to a new federally funded study published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Researchers from the National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UCLA and Princeton University examined how long COVID-19 survives in the air as well as on copper, cardboard, plastic and stainless steel and then compared it with SARS, the coronavirus that emerged in late 2002 and killed nearly 800 people.They found that COVID-19 was detectable in aerosols for up to three hours, up to four hours on copper, and up to 24 hours on cardboard.

"        How the Icahn-Ackman 'Battle of the Billionaires' on CNBC became a defining moment of the decade
			                 ",2019,12,13," As we get ready to say goodbye to the 2010s, CNBC.com is taking a look back at the key players, events and transformations from Wall Street to Silicon Valley to corporate America to the White House that shaped a ""Decade of Disruption."" In the lead-up to New Year's Day 2020, CNBC's online journalists will be exploring the moments that defined the past 10 years for your money and set the table for the next decade and beyond.The public and oftentimes nasty wars waged by activist investors this decade are personified by the 2013 ""Battle of the Billionaires"" on CNBC.The live, on-air brawl nearly seven years ago featured Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman. The epic fight over their opposing views on global nutritional supplements company Herbalife played out on ""Fast Money Halftime Report"" with CNBC's Scott Wapner from the New York Stock Exchange.They scorched the phone lines with insults and accusations for nearly a half-hour to the ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" of traders from the floor of the NYSE. It would have been hard to believe at the time — but about 18 months later, they'd hug it out at CNBC's premier investor conference.Long before they squared off on CNBC, Icahn, 83, and Ackman, 30 years his junior, made their bones on Wall Street in very different times. But they both are still actively investing.Icahn still runs his eponymous company, Icahn Enterprises, more than 30 years after his 1985 takeover of Trans World Airlines. In November, Icahn said he bought a 4.24% stake in printer and PC maker HP Inc., and supports a merger with Xerox. He also owns a 10.6% in the copier company.Ackman burst on the investment scene in the early 2000s as a 30-something who saw success with activist positions in Wendy's, mall operator General Growth Properties and Canadian Pacific Railway. On Monday, Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management revealed a position in Agilent Technologies.The hedge fund billionaires in January 2013 found themselves in a bitter feud stemming from Ackman's $1 billion bet against Herbalife stock. The back-and-forth came to a head on live television.The brawl began with Ackman, in a phone interview on ""Fast Money Halftime Report,"" defending himself against attacks from Icahn over publicizing the short the month before and agreeing to have Icahn call into the show.Once on the line, Icahn called Ackman a ""liar"" early on, accusing his rival of having ""one of the worst reputations on Wall Street."" Icahn later said to Ackman, ""I wouldn't invest with you if you were the last man on Earth.""Ackman countered by saying, ""Icahn unfortunately does not have a good reputation for being a handshake guy.""Icahn said that Ackman is the ""quintessential example that on Wall Street, if you want a friend, get a dog.""Ackman blasted Icahn: ""This is not a guy who keeps his word. This is a guy who takes advantage of little people.""About a month after the battle, Icahn revealed in a filing a huge stake in Herbalife, effectively taking the other side of the short, which Ackman defended for months, saying the stock would go to zero and accusing the multilevel marketing company of being a ""pyramid scheme."" Herbalife frequently and repeatedly denied those charges.Icahn and Ackman would remain entrenched on either side of the Herbalife trade for years — but in a surprise joint appearance at the CNBC-Institutional Investor ""Delivering Alpha"" conference in July 2014, they made up and hugged each other.Fast-forward nearly four years, Icahn told CNBC in March 2018 that he made a billion dollars from his investment in Herbalife. He said at the time that his relationship with Ackman was still friendly. A month earlier, Ackman had told CNBC that he exited his losing bearish bet against Herbalife.Looking at Herbalife since Ackman's short was first revealed about seven years ago, the stock has basically doubled.The shares were trading around $21 each on Dec. 19, 2012, when CNBC broke the news about Ackman's bet, which he would detail a day later at the Sohn Conference in New York City.The stock traded down in the teens in the aftermath of Ackman's short before recovering to around $40 a year later. The stock would retest those 2012 lows in 2015.The stock hit all-time highs around $60 at the beginning of this year. It's down about 23% for 2019 compared with the S&P 500's 26% advance over the same period. Herbalife closed Thursday at about $46 per share.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/13/reliving-the-carl-icahn-and-bill-ackman-herbalife-feud-on-cnbc.html

Protege was the biggest early investor with John Paulson's Credit Opportunities Fund that bet against subprime mortgages and earned Paulson & Co. $15 billion in 2007.""Jeff had a gift for thinking ahead of industry trends and had an irrepressible entrepreneurial spirit,"" said Ted Seides who co-founded Protege with Tarrant in 2001.""From the first database for hedge funds, early seeding of managers and shorting credit and subprime before the financial crisis, to his most recent passion for machine learning, Jeff held forward-thinking original ideas and a drive to bring them to fruition,"" added Seides, who hosts Capital Allocators podcast.News of his death generated an outpouring on social media and within the hedge fund industry with many sharing anecdotes of how Tarrant helped them.Jeff ""was keen to develop and support talent, then step back to let them stand on their own feet. May he rest in peace,"" Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz and former chief executive at Pacific Investment Management Co. wrote on Twitter.Two years ago Tarrant was diagnosed and treated for brain cancer. He stepped back from day-to-day management and moved into a newly created role of chairman, appointing Carol O'Donnell, who had been the firm's chief compliance officer, as chief executive officer.At the height of the financial crisis, Tarrant and Seides in 2008 made a $1 million bet with Warren Buffett, long considered one of the world's most successful investors, that their basket of chosen hedge funds would outperform a Standard & Poor's 500 stock index fund over 10 years. They lost. Still Tarrant told the Financial Times in 2017 that he felt he had won given all the access he had to Buffett over the decade.Tarrant graduated from Harvard Business School and co-managed the Sequoia Fund, a prominent portfolio, early in his career.

The Pershing Square returns represent sizable outperformance versus the broader market despite the best annual start for the S&P 500 since 1997, with the index up 17.35% through June 30.If Ackman is able to eke out returns just 5 percentage points higher by the end of the year, he'll have reached 50%. After that point, he'll be allowed to generate an incentive fee of 16% on any returns above.Pershing's recent success is in large part thanks to the outperformance of a handful of lucrative equity investments and keen stock picking, such as Chipotle Mexican Grill, Starbucks and Howard Hughes Corp. Ackman manages the public vehicle's portfolio though investment firm Pershing Square Capital Management.In a May letter to Pershing stakeholders, Ackman highlighted ""significant progress"" at burrito chain Chipotle under CEO Brian Niccol, noting strong same-store sales and transaction growth. That operational execution helped buoy Chipotle, which was up 70% through the end of June.""Despite the 63% year-to-date increase in the share price, we believe that Chipotle is in the early innings of its transformation,"" Ackman wrote at the time. The activist investor first bought Chipotle stock in 2016 at an average price of $405 per share. Since then, the stock has gained 77% to about $717 on Tuesday.Another strong performer for Pershing this year is Howard Hughes, which recently hired bankers at Centerview Partners to explore strategic alternatives that include a sale of the company, people familiar with the matter told CNBC last week.A potential take-private buyout could help the company realize a valuation that the Hughes board, led by  Ackman as chairman, feels is appropriate. The stock is up 32% year to date.Restaurant Brands International is also well ahead of the S&P 500 this year, buoyed by organic pretax earnings growth at each of its three brands. Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons in particular should be set for big sales growth following the launch of its loyalty program. The stock is also up 32% this year.The 2019 gains may help attract flows back into Ackman's fund, which suffered a string of losses in recent years. In early 2018, the fund's assets were down by roughly half from their $20 billion peak in 2015.

"        Howard Hughes Corp hires Centerview Partners to explore alternatives, including a sale: Sources
			                 ",2019,06,27," Howard Hughes Corp., an owner, manager and developer of different types of real estate throughout the U.S., has hired bankers at Centerview Partners to explore strategic alternatives that include a sale of the company, according to people familiar with the situation.The company, a one time spinoff from General Growth Properties, has been struggling to command a valuation that the board, led by its Chairman Bill Ackman, feels is appropriate for a company with its collection of assets and performance metrics.People familiar with the board's thinking say it is unclear the company is well suited to the public markets because — unlike most other real estate companies — it is not a REIT, but a C-Corp and has a diverse collection of assets that does not lend itself to the recurring and predictable cash flows real estate investors may be looking for.The company is both an owner of land, such as 60 acres of beach front in Honolulu, and a developer of residential communities, such as the Woodlands in Houston and commercial developments such as the South Street Seaport, only a few blocks east of the New York Stock Exchange in downtown Manhattan.With vacant land, planned communities, shopping developments, self-storage facilities and a longer-term outlook to profit off those holdings, Howard Hughes may not be best for the public markets, at least judging from the stock's performance over the last three years.It is down 14%, while both builders and REITS are far higher. That has led management and the board to explore a sale, though its bankers are also exploring joint ventures or spinoffs as part of their mandate, according to people familiar with the situation. The bankers hope to complete the review process by the end of summer.Ackman, who controls 4% to 5% of the company including stock and derivatives, is said to be fully supportive of the plan to review alternatives. The Pershing Square Capital Management manager did not return calls for comment, nor did representatives of Howard Hughes Corp.Potential buyers are likely to include giant real estate holders such as Blackstone Group or Brookfield Property Partners. Others could include some of the largest family offices or sovereign wealth funds that are willing to patiently try to harvest a net asset value that analysts estimate at $130 to $170 per share.In a bullish note out just Thursday morning, analysts at Citi cited the stock's underperformance and said it is in part due to a slower-than-anticipated leasing of space at the South Street Seaport.Howard Hughes shares jumped more than 41.7% on Thursday. The company later in the day confirmed that it was conducting ""a broad review of potential strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value"" and that these included a possible sale or change in the ""corporate structure of the company.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/27/david-faber-howard-hughes-corp-hires-centerview-to-explore-sale.html

For Ackman — long a proponent of menu and service innovations at his restaurant investments — Niccol's hand in Taco Bell's ""Live Mas"" tagline and popular Doritos Locos Tacos likely represented a chance to bring similar ingenuity to Chipotle.Ackman first bought Chipotle stock in 2016 at an average price of $405 per share. Since then, the stock has gained 76% to about $713 Friday.Restaurant Brands International is also well ahead of the S&P 500 this year, buoyed by organic pretax earnings growth at each of its three brands. Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons in particular should be set for big sales growth following the launch of its loyalty program less than one month ago; nearly 20% of Canadians have already enrolled, Ackman wrote.To compare, about 5% of the U.S. population is enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards loyalty program. Pershing Square is also an investor in the Seattle-based coffee company.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/bill-ackmans-rebound-continues-as-fund-manager-posts-40percent-this-year.html
"        Biggest holdings of Bill Ackman, who is doubling the return of the S&P 500
			                 ",2019,02,13," Activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings is off to a strong start in 2019 thanks to some key new stakes and outperformance of prior investments.The hedge fund reported on Wednesday that its portfolio is up 24.7 percent this year, easily topping the S&P 500's 9.7 percent return. This follows four-straight years of negative returns for his fund. According to the latest holdings, the fund's biggest stakes include Restaurant Brands, Lowe's, Chipotle, United Technologies and Automatic Data Processing.In a presentation, Ackman noted that Chipotle, ADP and Starbucks were among the biggest boosters to the fund this year. He also discussed a smaller position in Hilton.Chipotle continues to prove a lucrative investment for the longtime stock picker, who remains one of the restaurant's largest stakeholders. The burrito chain buoyed Pershing's gross returns by 6.2 percent in 2018 and is up more than 38 percent this year.Ackman, whose initial 2016 investment in Chipotle came at an average price of $405, helped bring aboard Brian Niccol as the company's CEO in March. The former Taco Bell executive has long championed innovation and outside-the-box thinking at his restaurants. Niccol has been pushing digital and marketing investments to bring the company back to consistent growth. Digital orders typically mean a higher check for restaurants, not to mention reducing in-store lines.""Brian and his team have made significant progress turning around Chipotle and reaccelerating growth,"" Ackman wrote in Pershing Square's shareholder presentation. ""Reigniting same-store sales growth is the key priority for 2019.""Ackman and his partners are seeing evidence of burgeoning comp sales. Same-store sales grew 6.1 percent in the fourth quarter, topping consensus expectations of 4.49 percent growth; profits also beat analyst expectations when it reported earnings on Feb. 6.Another strong performer for Ackman this year has been United Technologies, the $107 billion Dow component that manufactures industrial equipment like freight elevators and moving walkways. Though the new stake actually weighed on Pershing's performance in 2018, the stock is up more than 17 percent since Jan. 1.United Technologies is a ""high-quality industrial conglomerate with market-leading businesses in aerospace, elevators and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning,"" Ackman's presentation read. The ""upcoming business separation should be a catalyst for significant share price appreciation.""The activist shareholder added that United Technologies appears well insulted from the current trade dispute between the United States and China and has seen ""limited impact"" from tariffs. In a 2018 shareholder letter, Ackman said he would explore a breakup of the conglomerate.One investment that has yet to post significant outperformance for Pershing Square is Hilton Worldwide. The fund announced in October that it had acquired a 3.7 percent stake in the global hotel operator, shortly after shares hit a more than one-year low on concerns over a slowdown in the hospitality business.The stock has largely matched the performance of the S&P 500 this year, up 9.6 percent year to date. The S&P 500 is up 9.9 percent since the start of the year. Still, Pershing remains optimistic that its stake will prove itself a smart idea.""Hilton is a high-quality, asset-light, high-margin business with significant growth potential led by a superb management team,"" Pershing Square told clients Wednesday. Its ""collection of scaled brands and [its] loyalty program create strong network effects for consumers and cost and revenue advantages for hotel owners.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/here-are-the-biggest-holdings-of-bill-ackman-who-is-doubling-the-return-of-the-sp-500-this-year.html
"        Bill Ackman is making a comeback with his hedge fund up more than 24% this year
			                 ",2019,02,13," Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is on the comeback trail.His fund Pershing Square says it is up 24.7 percent in 2019 through Tuesday. The fund has made a number of headlines in the past year for new stakes in Starbucks and Hilton Worldwide Holdings.Ackman said in his most recent shareholder letter that the recent outperformance has been driven by investments in ADP, Lowe's, Starbucks and Chipotle. During the third quarter of 2018, Pershing dissolved its stake in global packaged foods company Mondelez and took a stake in coffee giant Starbucks at an average cost of $51 per share. That means the hedge fund manager is already up about 37 percent on the investment.The fund also saw success in its bet on burrito restaurant Chipotle, which is up more than 136 percent over the past 12 months at $593.66 per share. Ackman helped Chipotle install Brian Niccol — who arrived with a successful track record at Taco Bell — as CEO early last year and has remained a proponent of innovative menu and delivery options. Pershing Square was the second-largest holder of Chipotle shares according to the most recent government filings. Ackman first bought Chipotle stock in 2016 at an average price of $405 per share.Pershing made a quick $100 million in profit from a stake in Nike it sold last year.The good times for Ackman and Pershing Square come after a spell of negative returns for the activist investor. By early 2018, the hedge fund's assets had been more than cut in half from their peak above $20 billion in 2015. The fund saw its net asset value decline 4 percent in 2017 and slip 0.7 percent in 2018; the S&P 500 gained 19 percent in 2017 and fell more than 6 percent in 2018.Some of Pershing's challenges in the past few years included a $4 billion loss on its stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Ackman's short of nutritional supplement company Herbalife proved costly not only in money lost, but also in reputation because of the high profile battle over the company with Carl Icahn.",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/13/bill-ackmans-pershing-square-is-up-more-than-24percent-so-far-this-year.html
"        Yelp hires Evercore for activist defense after hedge fund calls for sale and board overhaul
			                 ",2019,02,06," Yelp, the review site for restaurants and local businesses, has hired Evercore to help defend the company against an activist investor, who recently called for a board shake-up and potential sale, according to people familiar with the matter.Hedge fund manager SQN, which owns 4 percent of Yelp shares, released a presentation on Jan. 16, about the company's ""significant underperformance,"" and said that based on its own research ""an immediate sale to a private equity firm could yield a $47 to $50 stock price."" The shares are currently trading at $37.59.Yelp co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and the board have now tapped Evercore to work with the company and explore the market, but the bank hasn't started running a sales process, said the people, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential. At the current market valuation of over $3 billion, there are few, if any, ""credible buyers,"" one of the people said.Representatives from Yelp and Evercore declined to comment. SQN's report suggests that the company is worth $4 billion or more. But SQN, a technology-focused hedge fund with more than $1.1 billion in assets, is a virtual unknown in the world of activist investing, where Carl Icahn, Bill Ackman and Daniel Loeb are among the most recognizable and influential players. Yelp is SQN's first activist investment.Yelp has struggled to fend off competition from Google, which is both the largest search engine and a rival in the reviews market. Google reviews and Instagram photos of food and restaurants have given consumers new ways to find recommendations for restaurants.Yelp has also lagged behind other companies that offer tools and technology to measure the effectiveness of ad spend, and has failed to keep up with Google's local discovery features, SQN claimed in its investor presentation.Shares of Yelp have plunged by more than half over the past five years and are down 15 percent in the past 12 months. SQN said that Yelp has underperformed the Russell 2000 Technology Index by 117 percent and its own peer group by about 74 percent over the last half-decade.Yelp has been on the M&A market in the past. The company hired Goldman Sachs to run a sales process in 2015. That effort ended when Stoppelman decided not to move forward despite having several interested buyers, people familiar with the matter said at the time.The Evercore-led process could end up with the company looking for a buyer, especially if Yelp shares were to fall, sources told CNBC. Yelp hasn't made any decisions about selling this time around, the people said.SQN said in an email to CNBC that it knows of ""multiple buyers"" that would be interested in buying Yelp.Here's the firm's full statement.As we made clear in our detailed presentation released in January, SQN believes there are multiple pathways to significant value creation at Yelp, including through the company remaining public and implementing our recommendations, or through a sale of the company to a large universe of private or strategic buyers. We are unclear on how anyone could credibly state that potential buyers don't exist without having run a fulsome strategic process. As we've previously stated, we know of multiple buyers who would be interested, and we believe these potential acquirers would be eager to participate in such a process.WATCH: Yelp calls on the 2019 buy list for options traders",https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/yelp-hires-evercore-after-activist-hedge-fund-calls-for-sale.html

"        Short-seller Andrew Left to seek investor money for his first hedge fund
			                 ",2018,10,30," Andrew Left, the founder of Citron Research whose bets against companies from electric car maker Tesla to drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals made him one of Wall Street's most prominent short-sellers, is ready to put investors' money where his mouth is.After investing only his own wealth for roughly two decades, Left is speaking to potential investors about launching Citron Capital, his first-ever hedge fund, that will begin trading in weeks, he told Reuters in an interview. The move could give Left more firepower to go after some of the biggest U.S. companies.While Left will continue to bet against companies, he said he will use the new fund to also bet that some companies' shares will rise.""If you find the right thing, it is always the right time for short activism,"" Left said. ""Fads, frauds and fading businesses are a constant even in rising markets,"" he added.Left, whose scathing reports on companies routinely send stock prices reeling, said he plans to raise ""a few hundred million of dollars"" from investors. He is expected to put in $10 million of his own money toward the fund, according to an investor presentation reviewed by Reuters.Potential investors will be required to invest a minimum of $2 million, leave their money locked up for one year, and pay standard hedge fund industry fees of a 1.5 percent management fee plus a 20 percent cut of the profits to Left, according to the investor prevention.Left is launching his fund as the stock market has sold off and investors are worrying about frothy valuations of many companies. He is also starting up just as some other prominent long-short equity hedge fund managers are going out of business.The S&P 500 ended trading on Monday just shy of confirming its second correction of 2018, hurt by fresh worries of an escalation of U.S.-China trade tensions and a sharp drop in big tech and internet names.Left has started meeting with wealthy investors such as family offices, and said he wished he had launched his new fund six weeks ago, before the stock market began tanking.Left, 48, who has spent the last 17 years running Citron Research, has earned millions by putting money behind his calls on companies. He earned an average annualized return of 89.98 percent between 2007 and 2017, according to the investor presentation seen by Reuters.Calling himself a contrarian who is not afraid to speak up or change his mind, Left made news last week when he changed his tune on Tesla. Left said in a research note that the company's Model 3 sedan is a ""proven hit,"" and that serious competition from other automakers for the plug-in car market had not materialized. He attributed his change of heart to a better understanding of the electric car industry and said he believed Tesla had turned the corner.So-called activist shareholders such as William Ackman and Nelson Peltz publish research to pressure companies to improve shareholder value, by taking actions such as boosting profits or putting a company up for sale. ""Short"" activist shareholders like Left, on the other hand, seek to persuade other shareholders to dump their stock on the basis that a company's flaws have not been priced in by the market.The average activist hedge fund's returns are roughly flat through the end of September, Hedge Fund Research data show. Several short activist hedge funds, on the other hand, have thrived.Eiad Asbahi's Prescience Point Capital Management is boasting gains of roughly 47 percent in the first nine months of this year after it alleged accounting fraud at trucking company Celadon, which is currently being investigated by the U.S. Justice Department. Sahm Adrangis Kerrisdale Capital, which made its reputation by betting against Chinese internet companies, was up 45 percent through the end of September. Ben Axler's Spruce Point Capital and Carson Block's Muddy Waters, which specialize in spotting corporate frauds, are delivering double-digit returns of roughly 18 percent, investors said.Now that investors are looking for assets uncorrelated to the stock market, short activists are beginning to pull in fresh money. ""By publishing our research (against a company) we lay out a more differentiated case and we find that to be more productive,"" Axler said.Left said he had several investment ideas for his fund and not all will be shorts.""I think Wayfair Inc is way over-valued. I would be long on China,"" Left said, adding that stocks like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com have bright futures.""For me, this is in my blood and I feel like I have another good 15 years left,"" Left said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/30/short-seller-andrew-left-to-seek-investor-money-for-his-first-hedge-fund.html

""We believe there is a favorable stock set-up into 2019 given menu innovation, digital initiatives, and a focus on improving restaurant margins.""Third-quarter results are expected to be just ""lackluster,"" the analyst said in a note to clients Monday, but sales should improve next year under CEO Brian Niccol's push for food innovation and customers remain loyal despite prior food safety concerns.In addition to the stock upgrade, the analyst raised his 12-month price target on Chipotle shares to $510 from $450, representing 19 percent upside from Friday's close. Shares of Chipotle rose 1.7 percent in premarket trading following the RBC upgrade.Much of Palmer's newfound conviction on Chipotle shares came from a new RBC survey in which more than 1,000 respondents answered questions about their recent visits, or lack thereof, to a CMG restaurant.Source: RBC Capital MarketsThe analyst said the survey resulted in four key findings: Chipotle remains in the top three favorite chains of all quick-service restaurants, there's a sizable opportunity to increase awareness of its digital capabilities, existing and lapsed customers are willing to try new offerings and food safety is only a small reason why customers do not eat at Chipotle.""What has sometimes been lost upon investors over the last three years has been that Chipotle continues to have one of the most loyal followings across all consumer brands,"" Palmer said. ""Chipotle ranks behind only Chick-Fil-A and Panera Bread in restaurant popularity among all respondents of the survey.""Any progress is likely welcome news to investors including Pershing Square activist Bill Ackman, who has leveraged his stake in the company to promote ideas like drive-thrus and breakfast offerings following a pullback in shares in the wake of the food safety incidents.Ackman applauded the appointment of Niccol as chief executive officer earlier this year. Niccol joined Chipotle following a successful track record at Taco Bell.""We're not just betting on a recovery from the food safety issue,"" Ackman told CNBC in November.

"        Cramer rips the current Fed, but stops short of his famous 'They know nothing' rant of 2007
			                 ",2018,10,10," CNBC's Jim Cramer tore into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, but stopped short of his famous 'They know nothing' rant from 11 years ago.""The fact is, I do have a better handle on the situation than the Fed does, just like in 2007,"" Cramer said on ""Mad Money"" Wednesday evening. ""Oh, I hate to show such hubris on this show, or anywhere or at home. But I am sick and tired of a Fed that reverts to a non-rigorous, non-homework-oriented approach every time things look good. It's like they unlearned all the lessons of the Great Recession.""In 2007, Cramer sounded off on then-Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and then-central bankers for ignoring signs of the impending financial crisis. ""They're nuts. They know nothing,"" Cramer blasted at the time.Cramer, in recent days, has been stepping up his criticism of the current Fed, blaming Powell and other policymakers for not looking more closely at the economic data before announcing its lockstep interest rate hike plans.Powell's remarks last week about monetary policy being a ""long way"" from neutral signaled a possibly more aggressive path for rate hikes, sparking a spike in bond yields to seven-year highs and applying pressure on stocks.On Wednesday, Wall Street took at real plunge, with the  dropping nearly , or 3.15 percent, in its worst one-session decline since February.Click here for Cramer's full sell-off playbook.On a  for the major averages, Cramer decided to open the phone lines to investors worried about the state of the stock market.His overarching message? ""The time to start buying may be upon us,"" because what started as selling has now grown into what seems to be a full-blown panic, he said.""A vicious correction is, indeed, a terrible thing to waste,"" he told viewers. ""If you have some spare cash or if you're thinking about putting some long-term money away at the end of the year, maybe you pull some of it forward. That's what I did today for my kids' index fund.""The reason Cramer felt a bit better about buying was due to a trend he noticed in the market's trading volume. Investors were selling at a 10 to 1 rate, meaning the volume was heavily skewed to the downside, a sign that things could be getting oversold.""On a day when volume was 10 to 1 on the downside, I am OK'ing small buys of some of the great stocks that we have followed and talk about,"" Cramer said.Click here for the stocks he's talking about and why selling now might not be the best idea.With shares of ,  and  now the targets of high-profile  — and the rest of the  — Cramer wanted to make sure investors weren't getting ahead of themselves.On Tuesday, hedge fund Pershing Square, run by Bill Ackman,  in the stock of Starbucks;  a $690 million stake in shares of PPG; and  its existing stake in Campbell Soup's stock.""You may be tempted to circle the wagons around companies that are being bolstered by activist investors,"" Cramer said. ""After all, if very smart, very rich money managers believe in a stock, you probably think, why shouldn't you?""But it's never quite that simple, and investors looking to buy one of the three may be left disappointed, the ""Mad Money"" host said.""Piggybacking on these activists is a mistake unless you really believe in the fundamentals of the company,"" he said.

""The economy's not quite as strong as the number indicated.""One of the real estate investor's chief concerns was the yield curve, which is so flat as to almost make borrowing money at a two-year rate the same as borrowing at a 30-year rate.""It's not what we're used to, but usually, it's a signal of a downturn. I think it is a signal of a downturn,"" he told Cramer.And with a $300 billion stimulus package, the tax cuts and the trade dispute with China on the government's plate, ""it's going to be tough"" to get a handle on the situation, Sternlicht suggested.""What people don't understand about the tariffs is you're going to see their impact, I think, in the first quarter of next year,"" he said. ""Because the inventory was here — it's on the shelves, it's in the warehouse, it was bought without the tariff. So you're going to have a latent inflation pressure in the market which the Chinese are trying to deflate by knocking their currency down.""Click here to watch Barry Sternlicht's full interview.If Carnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald has learned anything in his years as a cruise industry leader, it's that a day like today can't single-handedly every facet of the economy or even the market.""I am not a market expert, but I would say one day does not a trend line make, and the fundamentals and the U.S. economy and the world economy for the long term is what we have to look at,"" he told Cramer.And investors looking for safer plays amid the downturn could even consider a stock like Carnival, a global cruise line operator with a steady, secular business, the company's president and CEO said.""For our business, for the cruise industry, the reality is we're global and we are a great value, much better value than land-based vacations,"" Donald said.

"        Cramer vets the activist stakes in Starbucks, Campbell Soup and PPG
			                 ",2018,10,10," With shares of Starbucks, Campbell Soup and PPG Industries now the targets of high-profile activist investors — and the rest of the market in a tailspin — CNBC's Jim Cramer wanted to make sure investors weren't getting ahead of themselves.On Tuesday, hedge fund Pershing Square, run by Bill Ackman, announced a $900 million stake in the stock of Starbucks; Nelson Peltz's Trian Partners disclosed a $690 million stake in shares of PPG; and Daniel Loeb's Third Point raised its existing stake in Campbell Soup's stock.""You may be tempted to circle the wagons around companies that are being bolstered by activist investors,"" Cramer said. ""After all, if very smart, very rich money managers believe in a stock, you probably think, why shouldn't you?""But it's never quite that simple, and investors looking to buy one of the three may be left disappointed, the ""Mad Money"" host said.""Piggybacking on these activists is a mistake unless you really believe in the fundamentals of the company,"" he said. ""Hedge fund managers don't work for you and they have no obligation to tell you when they change their minds.""Cramer decided to break each situation down, starting with Campbell. Daniel Loeb and his hedge fund, Third Point Management, have been trying for weeks to replace the soup maker's board of directors and turn the heavily indebted company around.""Anyone who's followed Campbell knows that this current board has helped to destroy an immense amount of value, as the stock's been one of the worst performers in the food group for over the past decade,"" Cramer said. ""I think [Loeb]'s right. Campbell Soup needs a new board of directors and the company should quickly put itself up for sale.""While Campbell's ""fabulous brands,"" its balance sheet was too broken to recommend the stock, Cramer continued.""As much as I believe in Loeb's ability to effect change, I'd rather just buy a food company that's doing well,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.Starbucks, however, was an entirely different story.""The problem here is that I don't think Ackman necessarily has anything to offer,"" Cramer said, adding that his presentation offered ""nothing new or revelatory: China should be getting better. U.S. can get better. All obvious stuff.""In Cramer's view, Starbucks' business in China is already improving and the U.S. business won't see a significant upturn until the fourth quarter. Moreover, the company's aggressive buyback has been working, he said.""I've been saying that Starbucks is turning,"" he said. ""But even after the stock's 3 percent pullback today, I worry about Starbucks the stock. I don't think this quarter will be all that great. So why not be patient?""Reiterating his earlier call for investors to wait for Starbucks's stock to decline from its inflated levels before buying in, Cramer acknowledged Ackman's previous successes, most recently with Chipotle Mexican Grill.""Admittedly, Ackman's done well with the restaurant chains,"" he said. ""But here's the thing: activists work best when management is doing a bad job. Starbucks has good management — I think CEO Kevin Johnson is slowly but surely righting the ship [and] doing it the right way. I hope he's just not distracted by Ackman.""When it came to PPG, which pre-announced a sharply negative earnings report and forecast Tuesday before news of Trian Partners' investment broke, Cramer was speechless.""Frankly, I don't even know what to say about this one,"" he said, noting that shares of the specialty chemicals maker have ""done nothing"" since CEO Michael McGarry took over for former PPG chief Chuck Bunch, who happens to be a friend of Peltz's.""Earlier this year the company lost a key outlet for its Olympic Brand of paint when Lowe's stopped carrying the stuff. Ouch. PPG had a sloppy accounting scandal. Can't get my arms around it. Monday night, they pre-announced a huge shortfall in paint for automobiles,"" Cramer said. ""Now, Nelson Peltz knew Chuck Bunch from the old Heinz board of directors. I bet he wishes that Chuck were back running things.""""Peltz is very smart, he's engaged, but I don't think you can own PPG after such a dramatic shortfall. Even a brilliant billionaire might not be enough to protect this paint and coatings company from a slowing economy,"" the ""Mad Money"" host concluded.Here's where Cramer stands on each situation: Starbucks is a good long-term buy because the fundamentals are improving with or without Ackman; Campbell is a speculative play on whether or not Loeb can succeed in ousting the company's board; and PPG's deteriorating business may not survive even with Peltz at its side.""At the end of the day, though, these big-name money managers won't save you from a hideous market. That's not their job. Times like this are when you really need to do your own homework rather than piggybacking,"" Cramer said. ""So just keep that in mind the next time you see some stock surging on a bad day because we've heard about an engaged or active investor getting involved.""Questions for Cramer?

"        Bill Ackman reveals $900 million bet on Starbucks, sees shares doubling in three years
			                 ",2018,10,09," Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital revealed a new stake in Starbucks on Tuesday at a conference in New York.The hedge fund has 15.2 million shares or about $900 million worth at current prices. Starbucks shares popped after the news came out. They closed up 2 percent, to $57.71.Ackman's average cost for Starbucks was $51 a share, according to his presentation made at the Grant's Interest Rate Observer conference, which means the hedge fund manager is already up about 13 percent on the investment.""If SSS (same store sales) and valuation revert closer to historical average levels, we believe that SBUX shares can more than double over the next three years,"" the presentation said. It's a ""rare opportunity to own one of the world's best businesses at a discount.""Ackman also calls China the company's single largest growth opportunity and notes that Starbucks' current two-year share repurchase plan represents 20 percent of the company's market value.The activist investor said in August that the fund had taken a new undisclosed position that made up about 10 percent of the portfolio and that apparently was Starbucks. The fund also disclosed new stakes in United Technologies and Lowe's Cos. back then.In the food and beverage space, Pershing also holds shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Restaurant Brands International, which is the parent of Burger King and Tim Horton's, and Mondelez.Pershing has been trying to turn itself around after several years of lackluster performance and some high-profile blowups. Since its peak of $20 billion in 2015, the fund has lost more than half of its assets as investors fled abysmal returns amid a bull market.The fund has scored big this year on Chipotle, where it is the second-largest shareholder. Shares of the fast-food burrito chain are up 55 percent. It also made a quick $100 million in profit from a stake in Nike it sold earlier this year.Meanwhile Starbucks has been struggling with weak sales in the U.S. for several quarters. Its hope was that offering more cold beverages and new lunch items would draw people into its cafes. However, the coffee giant has also had to scale back its store growth and close a number of underperforming company-owned cafes in densely populated areas. Starbucks usually closes about 50 stores annually, but expects to shutter about 150 next year. The company also plans to reduce the number of new licensed stores in 2019 by about 100.In a statement, Starbucks said: ""We view the active, engaged dialogue that we have with shareholders as critical input into our strategic approach and we value constructive feedback on delivering long-term shareholder value. We look forward to maintaining a productive dialogue with Mr. Ackman as we do with all of our shareholders.""The stock is little changed in 2018.Through September, Pershing Square had $8.3 billion of assets under management and its net performance was up 15.8 percent.— CNBC's Sarah Whitten contributed to this report.WATCH: Here's why Starbucks failed in Australia",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/09/bill-ackmans-pershing-reveals-stake-in-starbucks.html
"        Who is the Real-Life Barry Cohen in new Hedge fund novel?
			                 ",2018,09,21," In his new novel, Gary Shteyngart chronicles the fall of a rich hedge fund manager on the run from his past and the law after his fund collapses.Sound familiar?To many, the character of Barry Cohen in Shteyngart's new novel, ""Lake Success,"" will bear some resemblances to hedge fund titans like Steve Cohen or Bill Ackman. And Barry Cohen is the latest in a long line of fictional Masters of the Universe who are held up for public scorn – from Gordon Gekko in the movie ""Wall Street"" to Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy in ""Bonfire of the Vanities"" to Bobby Axelrod in Showtime's series ""Billions.""But in an interview with CNBC, Shteyngart said Barry Cohen isn't based on a single person – but a collage of various hedge fund managers he met and spent time with over four years of researching the book.""I take characters, I put a bunch of influences in the meat-grinder and we chop it all down,"" he said. ""Obviously there are some influences like Valeant. But also someone like (Martin) Shkreli pops up,"" he said referring to the disgraced hedge fund manager and pharmaceutical company Valeant, which recently changed its name to Bausch Health. Both Shkreli, who ran Turing Pharmaceuticals, and Valeant gained notoriety and congressional inquiries for dramatically hiking the prices of life-savings drugs.Shteyngart is famous for his prescient, thoroughly reported novels. His last novel, ""Super Sad True Love Story,"" delved into Silicon Valley and the effects of technology and predicted a wave of class-based New York protests similar to Occupy Wall Street.Shteyngart said he decided to write about hedge fund executives because as a Manhattan resident, they dominated the social scene and economy.""I looked around my neighborhood in Manhattan and I realized I didn't know anyone,"" he said. ""All my friends had been priced out long time ago. Who's left? I started talking to them and I realized everyone worked at a hedge fund or private equity or if you were really poor, an investment bank.""In the book, Barry Cohen's life begins to fall apart after a failed investment in a pharma company called ""Valupro,"" which bears a striking resemblance to Valeant. Valupro is described as putting shareholders before customers, shrinking R&D costs and making profits by raising drug prices and doing corporate inversions.In describing what hedge fund managers actually do to make their millions (and sometimes billions), Barry explains:""Hedge funds are a story about how we're going to make money. They are about being smart, gaining access, associating with someone great ... You are bringing your investors something far more elusive than a metric. You're bringing them a story of how great you'll be together.""After the stock collapses and Barry gets implicated in an insider trading scandal, he leaves his wife and son and their Manhattan penthouse, ditches his wallet and phone and takes a Greyhound bus across the country to re-discover ""his tender young self.""Shteyngart said that the hedge-fund world is a lot like his former high school.""I went to Stuyvesent High School, which is a math and science nerd school in Manhattan, "" he said. ""There we were obsessed about our GPA. I still remember mine, 88.694. And these guys are obsessed about their basis points on their Bloomberg monitors. So for me it almost felt like a complete continuation of that.""Shteyngart said that when it came to his own investing, many of the hedge funders gave him the same advice: ""They said don't invest with me. They said buy low-cost index funds.""Asked about the subject of his next project, Shteyngart said he's leaning more toward Moscow than Greenwich.""I was born in Russia, so Russia's liaison with our current government is something I want to look into.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/21/who-is-the-real-life-barry-cohen-in-new-hedge-fund-novel.html
"        Einhorn's Greenlight off 25% for year; Ackman up double-digits
			                 ",2018,09,01," Billionaire investor David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund, whose bets on car companies General Motors and Tesla both moved against him in August, lost 7.6 percent this month, leaving the fund down 25.1 percent for the year, two investors said on Friday.    Einhorn sent investors his monthly update after the market closed on Friday but gave no specific reason for the fresh losses, people who received it said.    Shares of General Motors, one of Einhorn's largest holdings, fell 3.4 percent.    Greenlight is also one of a handful of hedge funds that took a short position on Tesla - betting that the stock would fall.That took a toll when Tesla founder Elon Musk shocked markets in early August by tweeting that he was mulling taking the company private.    Tesla's stock, after rising and then falling during the month, fueled by Musk's decision to remain a public company after all, ended the month up, hurting short sellers.    Einhorn investors have been losing patience with him for some time and have been pulling money out. August's numbers could prompt more departures at year-end when the manager will next let investors redeem money, one person said.    An Einhorn spokesman declined to comment.    At the same time, Daniel Loeb's Third Point, currently pushing Nestle to spin off units and working on getting Campbell Soup to put itself up for sale, posted only tiny gains in August. His Third Point Partners fund inched up 0.1 percent, leaving it up 0.9 percent for the year-to-date, an investor said. William Ackman, the third in the trio of managers who for many years shared many of same investors, has swung to big gains this year, and his private hedge fund is up roughly 15 percent for the year, an investor said.    His gains have been fueled by strong performances at Automatic Data Processing, Chipotle Mexican Grill and Lowe's Companies, one of his more recent investments.

""I think there [are] opportunities to use what we have and present it in new forms, new varieties, to get people re-engaged with what they love about Chipotle.""Such initiatives are likely welcome news to investors like Pershing Square activist Bill Ackman, who has leveraged a 10 percent stake in the company to encourage ideas like drive-thrus and breakfast offerings to reignite the beleaguered shares following a series of food safety issues.Chipotle shares are up 70 percent this year, and Morgan Stanley thinks that run will continue.

"        Cramer's 4 reasons for why Tesla's shorts are facing an uphill battle with Elon Musk
			                 ",2018,08,08," Short-sellers might be rigorous in their methods, but Tesla CEO Elon Musk hasn't made it easy to short the stock of his automaker, CNBC's  said Wednesday.""There are four fundamental problems that make shorting stocks especially dangerous, problems that are bedeviling these professional pessimists as they confront perhaps the greatest short-buster in modern memory, ... Elon Musk,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.Cramer spoke one day after Musk floated the idea of taking Tesla private on Twitter, igniting an 11 percent run in the stock and costing Tesla's short-sellers roughly $1.3 billion. Tesla's board of directors maintained in a statement on Wednesday that no final decision has been made.Musk's $420-a-share price target showed ""why it's so tough to bet against individual companies,"" Cramer argued, turning to the first flaw: the notion that Musk did something wrong by opining on his company's future.""Musk has every right to say that he has a potential $420-per-share takeover bid lined up, provided that he doesn't sell stock into the hype,"" Cramer explained. ""As long as there's no dump with the pump, it's arguably a legitimate thing to say.""""Why not? The SEC doesn't specifically say you can't ponder what a company's worth or whether the company might get a bid,"" he continued. ""In fact, Twitter's absolutely ... the place to disseminate this possibility.""Second flaw? The presumption that a government agency like the Securities and Exchange Committee (SEC) or the Justice Department will get involved if something illegal or inappropriate is occurring, Cramer said.To illustrate this flaw, the ""Mad Money"" host referenced ""When the Wolves Bite,"" a chronicle by CNBC's Scott Wapner of the heated battle between Wall Street titans Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman in the stock of Herbalife.""This is something that Bill Ackman learned the hard way when he publicly shorted Herbalife,"" Cramer said. ""Ackman, in desperation, did everything he could to get any federal agency to crack down on Herbalife and put it out of business because of what he saw as some really atrocious business practices.""""In the end, Ackman lost a fortune because no agency took the bite,"" he said.Third, the short-sellers — whose strategy involves borrowing shares of a stock on the belief that it will decline, selling them and then buying them back at a lower price, thus turning a profit — rely on other sellers to knock their desired stock down.""Who in his right mind is going to sell Tesla if there's even a possibility of a leveraged buyout?"" Cramer said, referring to Musk's assertion that funding has been ""secured"" and a Financial Times report that said Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund bought a 3 to 5 percent stake in Tesla.Fourth, Cramer took some inspiration from the words of legendary investor and economist John Maynard Keynes: In the long run, we're all dead.""I think Elon Musk can keep the balls in the air longer than the shorts can stay short,"" he said. ""He could've told the Saudis that he'd sell them $2 billion in stock right from the company if he wanted to, right? Then what?""All in all, Musk's power to sway Tesla's investors and secure funding from giants like Tencent for his electric car maker made Cramer believe in his ability to out-maneuver the shorts in the near term.""You've got to understand: Elon Musk is a weird mix of Thomas Edison, David Blaine, and the Punisher. He's a showman, a visionary, and he's ruthless,"" Cramer said. ""I wouldn't recommend Tesla up here, but you know what? You'd be crazy to short it.""Shares of Tesla ended Wednesday's trading session down 2.43 percent, at $370.34.

"        US regulator shelves reform on voting in board fights
			                 ",2018,07,11," The U.S. securities regulator has shelved a proposed Obama-era reform that would have given shareholders in companies more freedom to vote for their preferred candidates during contested board elections, people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.The proposal made by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) two weeks before President Donald Trump's election victory would have changed how shareholders vote during activist investor-led fights for board seats, an issue that has divided companies and investors for years.SEC officials have said publicly in recent months that the proposed rule-change remains a priority, raising hopes among activist investors who have pushed for changes, including Pershing Square Capital Management's William Ackman, that the SEC will finalize and implement the rule soon.However, several people familiar with the matter told Reuters the Commission's new boss Jay Clayton has in fact shelved the proposal, in what will be a disappointment for many investors who say the current system favors company management in board fights.Right now, shareholders voting remotely have to choose from a full slate of board directors nominated by the management or a competing set of nominees provided by an activist investor.Unlike in many countries such as Canada and Australia, U.S. investors cannot mix and match from these competing lists unless they send a representative to vote in person at the annual meeting.According to the SEC, the vast majority of votes in the United States are cast remotely, so such constraints can influence who ultimately ends up controlling the board and company strategy.Activist investors say the present system works against them because shareholders are more likely to play it safe and vote for the management list, even if they like some of the activists' candidates. Companies say changing the rules would spark more disruptive and harmful activist-led fights.In October 2016, the SEC under Clayton's predecessor Mary Jo White proposed the so-called ""universal proxy"" rule allowing shareholders to remotely vote from a mix-and-match list.But Trump's victory subsequently saw the Republican party, which is eager to loosen rules it says are deterring firms from going public, take over the SEC with Republican Commissioner Michael Piwowar becoming acting chair in January 2017 until Clayton's appointment in May 2017.The people, who declined to be named because internal SEC discussions are private, said the ""universal proxy"" proposal was dead for the foreseeable future.They said it was unlikely Clayton, a political independent who leans toward the right, would support the rule given he has said his priority is to boost company listings.While Piwowar, who strongly opposed the rule, finished his term this month, Clayton's vote would likely still be necessary to finalize the changes, one of the people said.For a rule change to pass, the majority of commissioners must vote for it.Hester Peirce, the other Republican commissioner, told Reuters she had ""not come to any conclusions"" on the issue and would need to review all the industry comments before doing so.The proposal is still on the agency's official long-term agenda, but has fallen off a list of its 12-month priorities drawn-up in March.While some senior SEC officials would like to reprise the rule, this is unlikely to happen under the current administration, the people said.Clayton declined to comment.Tim Goodman, director at Hermes EOS, the stewardship arm of Hermes Investment Management which advises clients with $464 billion of assets, says the current U.S. system causes ""practical difficulties for shareholders, including ourselves, who have to take account of the time and cost of attending the meeting in person.""Goodman said that Hermes, which votes on behalf on clients who invests in more than 10,000 companies globally, would vote for different directors in some U.S. board fights if the rules were changed.Kai Liekefett, head of the shareholder activism practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said in several recent proxy fights, including the high profile contests at Automatic Data Processing in 2017 and DuPont in 2015, several large institutional investors were interested in voting for both activist and management candidates, but were not able to do so under the current system.While investors say they are losing out, business groups, most notably the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, have lobbied to preserve the status quo. The influential group has argued the new rule would increase fights, balkanize boards, and discourage listings, according to a public letter.But investors and groups representing pension funds cite academic evidence disputing the notion it would favor activist investors and prompt more fights.A Harvard Law School study of contests between 2001 and 2016 found that a mix-and-match ballot did not favor special interests or spark more fights. In some cases, it could even favor the management.For example, New Jersey-based Destination Maternity, which had its entire board ousted after losing a shareholder vote in May, would have seen some management nominees keep their seats had investors been able to choose from both slates of candidates, according to people familiar with the vote.In fact, even without an SEC mandate, some companies adopt a universal proxy when they fear activist campaigns to replace their entire board are getting traction, because that way they can try to have some of their nominees voted through.Investors said they are not giving up.Chris Phillips, director of institutional relations at the Washington State Investment Board, said he met Peirce in March to try to persuade her to back the rule change.""Requiring physical attendance at many shareholder meetings in order to exercise such votes is impractical and antiquated,"" Phillips told Reuters in an email.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/us-regulator-shelves-reform-on-voting-in-board-fights-sources.html
"        Bill Ackman makes more layoffs at his Pershing Square hedge fund
			                 ",2018,06,27," Billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman, whose investment assets have shrunk by more than half in the last three years, has made a second round of staff cuts and laid off three investor relations team members, two sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.  The prominent manager cut one investor relations executive and two investor services executives at his New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund last week, the sources said. These layoffs come after Ackman cut his staff by 10 people in January, shrinking the firm to 46 employees from 56.  A spokesman for the firm declined to comment.  The fresh round of layoffs shows that Ackman, one of the industry’s most voluble activist investors, is moving forward with an overhaul that some had questioned but has so far been successful, involving both cost cuts and investment strategy changes.Pershing Square now oversees roughly $8 billion in assets, less than half the amount it managed at its peak in 2015. Assets dwindled after three years of losses which prompted many investors to ask for some of their money back.Unlike other managers who might try to replace departing capital, Ackman decided to re-tool his firm, telling clients that he wants to return to his roots by running a smaller firm and growing assets only through improved returns not by bringing in new investors.In addition to the layoffs, key members of his team have voluntarily left.Investment team member Ali Namvar retired and Vice Chairman Steve Fraidin returned to practicing law as a partner at Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.Investment team member Brian Welch is leaving at the end of this month. The investment team has historically had between eight and 10 members.In his early years, Ackman dazzled with double-digit returns, often delivering some of the industry’s best returns.As part of the revamp, Ackman, one of the industry’s most visible managers, said he would stay out of the limelight to concentrate on investments, leaving the visiting with clients to others. So far this year the firm has made bets on Nike, United Technologies, and Lowe’s.So far Ackman’s promises of delivering improved returns appear to be materializing. Through the middle of June, Pershing Square’s private hedge fund was up more than 9 percent while the publicly traded fund, Pershing Square, was up 11.4 percent since the start of the year.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/27/bill-ackman-makes-more-layoffs-at-his-pershing-square-hedge-fund.html

			                 ",2018,06,15," William Ackman's private hedge fund has gained more than 9 percent this year while his publicly traded fund is up double digits, marking a dramatic reversal for the billionaire investor after three years of losses.Pershing Square International climbed 9.3 percent from January through June 12, an investor in the fund said on Thursday. According to data from HSBC, the firm now ranks as one of the top 20 performing hedge funds for 2018.Pershing Square Holdings, the largest fund managed by Ackman's New York-based Pershing Square Capital Management, has climbed 11.4 percent since January, Pershing Square told clients late on Wednesday.Last month Ackman told clients that performance was improving as all of his portfolios were finally in the black for the year.Those gains have now grown and could signal a comeback for 52-year-old manager after three years of back-to-back losses that helped shrink Pershing Square's assets to roughly $8 billion, about half of what Ackman managed at the firm's peak in 2015.Despite years of poor performance, Ackman remains one of the industry's most closely watched managers at a time active management has come under fire for high costs, and as other prominent fund managers post sluggish returns.Ackman, who made three new investments this year, is now beating the average hedge fund's roughly flat return for the year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.Returns have been fueled by gains at Chipotle Mexican Grill and Automatic Data Processing.Burrito chain Chipotle, in which Pershing Square is the biggest investor with a 10 percent stake, saw its share price tumble to $251 after a string of food safety lapses.Ackman bought the stake in 2016 for an average cost of $405 and joked last year that his investment team would be eating Chipotle until the stock price recovered. Earlier this year he helped install Brian Niccol as chief executive and Chipotle closed at $460.44 on Thursday, gaining 58 percent since January.Automatic Data Processing, where Ackman lost a bitter proxy contest in late 2017, has climbed 19.75 percent since January to close trading on Thursday at $139.82, far above Ackman's average cost of $105 a share.The human resources software company held an investor day earlier this week and said its chief financial officer, Jan Siegmund, will be leaving.Ackman, who told investors earlier this year that he would be lowering his profile as he seeks to turn around the firm's performance, declined to comment.Last year Ackman had said he was ready for a comeback.

			                 ",2018,06,08," Bill Ackman's hedge fund notched a double-digit gain in May, getting a boost from investments like Lowe's, Chipotle Mexican Grill, and Automatic Data Processing.Pershing Square Holdings' 10.3 percent net return last month was its second-best month since 2014, while its 7.5 percent gain through June 5 was notably higher than the broader market's 3 percent climb over the same time. Pershing's latest moves include stakes in United Technologies and Lowe's,  both of which have outperformed the  in the past month. News of Ackman's $1 billion investment in Lowe's helped spark another rally in the company's shares, which are now up 18 percent in the past 30 days.Pershing's stake in the home improvement retailer joins that of D.E. Shaw, which has already wrestled three board seats and overseen the forthcoming retirement of chief executive Robert Niblock.Another bright spot for Pershing this year has been Chipotle, a company Ackman has heralded as a comeback in the works. The stock is up 56 percent this year, buoyed higher after former Taco Bell chief executive Brian Niccol agreed to lead the struggling burrito chain in February.Pershing Square declined to comment for this story.

"        Herbalife shares plunge after Carl Icahn lowers his stake in the company
			                 ",2018,05,25," Carl Icahn's Icahn Enterprises is finally taking some profits on its Herbalife winnings.On Friday the investor said he is lowering his stake in a securities filing. ""Yesterday IEP tendered its Herbalife shares into the Company's self-tender offer. Of the shares we tendered, at most only 11.4 million could possibly be purchased in the tender, which would still leave us as the Company's largest shareholder with at least 34.3 million shares,"" Icahn wrote. ""For almost six years, we have been one of Herbalife's strongest, most loyal supporters; we stood by the Company through a half-decade long short-selling campaign; and we never sold a share, even after our investment doubled. But, given that our Herbalife investment has become an outsized position, representing approximately 24% exposure to total NAV, it is only prudent for IEP to reduce its exposure.""Shares of Herbalife closed down 9.6 percent Friday.On Friday Herbalife announced the results of its tender offer. The company said it was ""oversubscribed"" with 49.7 million shares tendered. It expects to accept 11.4 million shares at a cash purchase price of $52.50 per share or roughly $600 million. Herbalife will fund the stock repurchase from its term loans, credit facilities or cash on hand.Icahn is selling 10.5 million Herbalife shares valued at approximately $550 million in the company's tender offer, according to a source familiar with the matter. Without Icahn's participation the offering would have been under-subscribed.Dow Jones was first to report the size of Icahn's tender offer sale.""There's an old Icahn rule, when you make over $1.5 billion on a situation, you sell a bit,"" Icahn told The Wall Street Journal.As the largest Herbalife shareholder, Icahn repeatedly battled Pershing Square's Bill Ackman  over his bearish stance on the nutritional supplement maker. In March Icahn took a victory lap on his profitable Herbalife investment, telling CNBC he had ""a billion"" dollar profit in the stock.The investor seemed to reference Ackman's exit from his losing bearish bet as a reason why he's reducing his stake.""We believe Herbalife's business is stable, the short-sellers have largely exited, and the Company is well-positioned for the future,"" Icahn said in the Friday filing.Herbalife did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/herbalife-shares-plunge-after-carl-icahn-said-he-is-lowering-his-stake-in-the-company.html

All three show promise for the rest of the year, according to some market strategists.TripAdvisor, one turnaround stock burning up the charts, looks like it has even more potential to Miller Tabak equity strategist Matt Maley. That stock has done a 180 this year, rebounding 41 percent after a 26 percent decline in 2017.""Over the last month, I was very worried about this stock because it was a little overbought, it was coming up against some key resistance levels,"" Maley told CNBC's ""Trading Nation"" on Tuesday. ""But it broke above those resistance levels.""TripAdvisor is now bumping up against the long-term trendline stretching back to its 2014 highs. Chances are good that it can break through that resistance level, Maley said.""The short interest in the stock is still very, very high so [if] you get another breakout move above another resistance level, those shorts are going to be squeezed again and it could move quite a bit higher,"" said Maley.Short interest in TripAdvisor shares is at 19.3 percent of its total float.Chipotle and Under Armour look like buys to Larry McDonald, editor of the Bear Traps Report. Chipotle is up 50 percent in 2018 after a 23 percent decline last year, while Under Armour has increased 39 percent following a 50 percent drop in 2017.""Definitely buy the dips in Chipotle and Under Armour, especially on the Chipotle side,"" McDonald said Tuesday on ""Trading Nation.""

			                 ",2018,05,14," Chipotle Mexican Grill's recovery efforts, including the appointment of a new chief executive and a new delivery partnership, represent steps in the right direction, according to Piper Jaffray.The firm reiterated its overweight rating on the restaurant company's shares, predicting Chipotle's stock price could top $530 in 12 months, the highest target on Wall Street and implying 25 percent upside from Friday's close. Piper's previous target was $420.""Chipotle shares remain a top recovery pick. When, and as (not ""if"") the recovery unfolds, meaningful leverage exists,"" analyst Nicole Regan said in a note Sunday. ""Our positive bias is based on culture change, strong unit-level economics and solid balance sheet. Catalysts include operational excellence, brand remodeling, and capital deployment.""The appointment of Brian Niccol as chief executive officer — who arrived with a successful track record at Taco Bell — as well as a new delivery partnership with DoorDash have supported the stock and sales, Regan said, and justify same-store sales expectations in excess of 2 percent.Shares of Chipotle rose 0.7 percent in premarket trading following Piper Jaffray's optimistic call. The shares are up 47 percent this year.While Niccol built a reputation for menu innovation at Taco Bell, he recently told CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that while investors shouldn't expect major changes to the company's offerings, items like breakfast burritos aren't out of the question.""Job No. 1 is to remind people why they love Chipotle,"" Niccol told CNBC in March. ""I think there [are] opportunities to use what we have and present it in new forms, new varieties, to get people re-engaged with what they love about Chipotle.""Such initiatives are likely welcome news to investors like Pershing Square activist Bill Ackman, who has leveraged a 10 percent stake in the company to encourage ideas like drive-thrus and breakfast offerings to reignite the beleaguered shares following a series of food safety issues.""We're not just betting on a recovery from the food safety issue,"" Ackman told CNBC in November.

"        Social and sustainable investing gets a boost from an unlikely source: Wall Street activists
			                 ",2018,04,27," Wall Street's activist investors, once known for pushing for extreme cost-cutting or just about anything that would boost the bottom line, are starting to use their money to promote a different kind of corporate action: social and environmental change.They are doing this, they say, not only as a matter of moral responsibility, but for their original mission of generating better returns for their clients.Socially responsible investing, long the bastion of faith-based activists and civic do-gooders, can now count several high-profile activists — including Clifton Robbins of Blue Harbour Group and Barry Rosenstein of Jana Partners – among its acolytes. This kind of investing is known as ""ESG"" for environmental, social and governance factors.Assets under management in U.S.-based socially responsible investing strategies climbed to $8.72 trillion at the start of 2016, roughly 20 percent of all investment under professional management and an increase of 33 percent from the start of 2014. Those numbers — published every two years by US SIF: the Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment, a Washington, D.C., trade group whose members include numerous mutual and pension funds — are likely higher given the growing interest in the space.While research remains limited, early academic analysis from Harvard Business School finds firms with an emphasis on environmental and social issues have a significantly higher annualized return.In an annual speech to hedge fund leaders last Tuesday, Robbins, Blue Harbour's chief executive, said that social and environmental considerations have become integral to how the fund's partners decide where to invest its $3 billion in assets.""This is hugely important – I think this is a new paradigm for smart investing,"" he told the crowd at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Summit last week. ""Now when I'm calling up a CEO three months after we make an investment, in addition to saying: 'Where are we on the spin-out? Where are we on the balance sheet? Where are we on the margins?' I'm saying, 'Where are we on that commitment you made to me to make the board more diverse?'""Known as ""the friendly activist,"" the Greenwich, Connecticut-based hedge fund prides itself on having never sued or run a proxy contest against a company since Robbins first founded the firm in 2004. Instead, Blue Harbour has made a name for itself through meticulous work with company management, a process Robbins considers ""one of the most important"" in determining whether to invest.That simultaneous focus on both management and ESG was recently put to the test when the fund accrued a 4 percent stake in software company Open Text, according to David Silverman, managing director at Blue Harbour who quarterbacks the fund's ESG efforts.For an industry infamous for its lack of gender diversity, Open Text's decision to appoint Madhu Ranganathan as chief financial officer this month came as welcome news to the Blue Harbour team.""Open Text just added a new CFO who happens to be a woman of diverse background ... we think she's going to be a great CFO,"" Silverman told CNBC. ""That's important at a tech company, as more broadly in the industry there have been issues of diversity and inclusion.""While taking steps to diversify a company's management or board may have its own ethical benefits, Silverman reiterated that Blue Harbour's focus on ESG stems from financial interest. It's those types of company-specific ESG concerns, he said, which can help concentrated activists unlock previously hidden value.But Blue Harbour isn't the only activist fund integrating socially responsible investing into fund management.Rosenstein's Jana Partners also has been exploring the space, most recently hiring former BlackRock fund manager Dan Hanson to oversee a new fund targeting companies on issues like climate change and wage inequality, according to a Reuters report.Jana is recruiting several social activists (and rock star Sting) to pool cash for the fund – expected to be called Jana Impact Capital – in its effort to put pressure on companies they feel can be better corporate citizens.In kicking off its latest push into socially responsible investing, the $5 billion hedge fund teamed up with the California State Teachers' Retirement System (or CalSTRS), which controls roughly $2 billion in Apple equity, to urge the iPhone maker to develop new settings to help parents control children's time on mobile devices. Jana believes  could easily fix what the firm sees as a pernicious problem of young people getting addicted to the tech giant's phones.""This should be an easy fix for Apple,"" Rosenstein told CNBC in January. ""There's no question that it needs to be more responsive to children's needs and children's activities.""The fund manager added that he's received ""hundreds and hundreds"" of letters and emails from parents supporting his position, which reflects the need for a fix.""There's overwhelming agreement in the general public about the need for this,"" he said.A forthcoming paper from Harvard Business School has given investors early hope that these types of investments could lead to more than good public relations.Part of the problem in determining whether firms with a focus on ESG outperform peers is parsing out which companies are ""for real,"" according to Harvard Business School professor George Serafeim, who leads the school's research and curricula center on corporate sustainability. For those who can pull it off, the rewards appear to be starting to show.Serafeim and his colleagues found that firms scoring in the top quintile of the total quintile of the total MSCI KLD index – a list of 400 U.S. securities with exposure to companies with ostensibly good ESG ratings – post significant, 2.16 percent higher annualized stock returns.This outperformance, his research finds, is driven solely by firms at the top quintile of a custom-designed materiality index, with companies in the top quintile of the index outperforming the market by 6.47 percent annually.""How can you say you've factored in ESG issues when you been invested in energy companies for years and yet have not had a single conversation about capital expenditure on emission?"" Serafeim told CNBC. ""What we have learned is that some of the ESG issues are actually financially material. ... Hedge funds are recognizing that, from the deep value perspective, this is a very useful lens."" Source: Hedge Fund Research, Inc. So many companies now identify sustainability issues as strategically important that the ""materiality"" of the reported sustainability investments for firm value is harder to determine, Serafirm said. For example, ESG issues for large internet and data companies like Facebook and Google – such as data privacy and employee diversity – are material issues. In contrast, for household and personal product companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever, packaging life cycle management and supply chain impacts are more material.However, Harvard's early research shows that of the more than 2,000 companies examined, those that drill down on firm- or industry-specific, ""material"" ESG issues significantly outperform.Questions remain for the trend in the short term, however, as President Donald Trump's administration actively pursues topics considered antithetical to long-term environmental sustainability.The president has resurrected the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, sought an end to ""the war on beautiful, clean coal,"" called climate change a hoax, pulled the U.S. from the global climate agreement signed in Paris in 2015 and appointed Scott Pruitt -- who's promised to roll back emissions regulations – as head of the Environmental Protection Agency.""This is a great benefit to the fossil fuel industry, to traditional investors in coal mines,"" said James Henry, former chief economist at McKinsey and senior fellow at the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment. ""The regulatory environment has also shifted against ESG investing. The EPA has essentially been strip mined.""""All of that doesn't augur well for U.S.-based ESG companies,"" he added. ""It's hard to believe this will be helpful to companies like Tesla, which are struggling to finance themselves anyway.""Still, it's unlikely Trump's actions alone could stem the flow of cash into sustainable investments. A burgeoning body of literature has hinted that companies that prioritize firm-specific ESG issues also tend to outperform as long-term investments.Analysts at advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services have also been following the trend as more and more funds express interest in the area.""It is helpful in particular to the hedge fund space, where we're only now getting information in recent years,"" said Marija Kramer, head of ISS' responsible investment business. ""We definitely have clients that look at just straight gender balance and others that look at experience, what committee which board members are sitting on, and whether that's in line with the company's business practices.""Kramer told CNBC that funds have come to ISS for advice on a variety of topics, from staying ahead of reputational risks on hot button issues like sexual harassment to incorporating green energy into their portfolios. The growing interest in ESG has, in turn, been accompanied by new ways of measuring sustainability, she added.""It's more quantifiable now,"" Kramer said. ""In addition to having the historical content, there's more research into the impact of ESG investment. ... It could even help performance.""Despite the early optimism behind the shift to ESG investing, it's clear to Pershing Square's Bill Ackman that Wall Street still has a lot of work to do when it comes to gender balance in activist investing and corporate board representation.""I actually have wanted to run a proxy contest with an all-female, diverse, ethnic slate. I think, first of all, that it would send an incredible message. And I think we'd win, hands down,"" Ackman said at the 13D Monitor summit. ""The difficulty for us has been recruiting directors, and in particular women in an activist context.""Ackman said he had initially considered two female directors for his Automatic Data Processing slate last year, but that one of the women dropped out as the bid became hostile. Pershing Square, which raised $500 million from investors to take a stake in ADP, eventually lost its proxy fight with fewer than 25 percent of the vote.""We had a phenomenal female director for our ADP slate, we had one on our slate,"" Ackman said. ""But we had another phenomenal director and she had been on the board of very important, interesting companies. She completely understood all the issues, she had a superb, relevant resume, but once it was a proxy contest she wasn't going to participate.""""I think what the shareholders can do is, the big institutions can make clear that the fact that someone hasn't served on a board before shouldn't disqualify them from being a credible candidate for the board,"" Ackman said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/27/social-investing-gets-a-boost-from-an-unlikely-source-activists.html
"        Cramer Remix: These tech titans aren’t breaking the bank - let them spend
			                 ",2018,04,25," Large-cap technology companies continue to invest like crazy. But most of Wall Street doesn't like it. But CNBC's Jim Cramer said it's not a bad thing.  ""Throughout this earnings period I've been struck by just how oblivious many investors are to the new tech food chain and how valuable it is"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. He pointed out how Amazon Prime has racked up 100 million viewers. YouTube adoption and cloud building are causing Alphabet to buy billions of dollars in capital equipment to meet the demand of YouTube, as capital expenditures increased by 121 percent compared with last year. ""When you're looking at tech, you want innovative companies with so many opportunities that they don't want to just save the money or shell out big dividends,"" Cramer said. And while many investors are abandoning the big tech sector as the 10-year Treasury hits 3 percent, Cramer said he will not.""The next time you blanche when you see insane levels of spending from these tech titans, remember, they're doing it for a reason,"" he said. ""This spending is necessary, imperative even, if these companies are going to keep generating phenomenal sales and amazing earnings growth, which is exactly what we want them to do. They're doing what they're supposed to do, people. Don't run from it, embrace it.""Savvy market watchers use volatility to fatten their portfolios with bargain stocks. But Cramer warns that this might not be the best move.""If we get more strength tomorrow, I think you should use it to take some profits and re-position rather than getting all excited and going all in,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said on Wednesday.""I don't want you to give up and go home, let alone sell everything,"" Cramer said. ""But there are very good reasons to be concerned here.""Tariffs, geopolitical issues and pricey tech stocks are just a few of the red flags investors need not ignore, Cramer said.The 10-year Treasury yield reached 3 percent Tuesday morning for the first time in five years, causing all major indices to plunge. But Cramer said there's no reason to start selling.""You now have lots of investors and commentators acting like this is indeed the end of the world, or, at the very least, I should say, the end of the bull,"" the host of ""Mad Money"" said on Wednesday.But, he said, ""I think their fear is misplaced.""In fact, Cramer said the 3 percent mark is more of a psychological barrier for investors.While rates are rising, Cramer recommends putting money into financial stocks like J.P. Morgan, large-cap technology companies such as Amazon and Facebook, and industrial companies like Boeing.Volatility continues amid geopolitical threats, fear of increased regulation in the technology sector and a rising 10-year Treasury yield. The Dow Jones industrial average closed nearly 425 points lower Tuesday, only to rebound 100 points Wednesday and closing nearly 60 points higher.""There's always a bull market somewhere,"" Cramer said Wednesday. ""But this one's a wild one. Not as easy to grab the bull by the horns.""But many market watchers remain on edge. Cramer said a safe bet is Facebook. Unlike other large-cap technology companies, Facebook has little exposure in China and will not be affected in the event of a trade war. Legendary investor Bill Ackman made an incredibly risky move when he bet that nutrition giant Herbalife would be shut down by the government, CNBC's Scott Wapner said on Wednesday.Ackman had bet that he would make $1 billion in his short against the nutrition-selling company, accusing it of being a pyramid scheme.""It was a binary bet and it's dangerous. He was betting that the government was going to intervene and shut Herbalife down,"" Wapner told Cramer. ""There was no in-between.""Wapner's new book, ""When the Wolves Bite: Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle,"" chronicles Ackman's five-year-long battle against another iconic activist investor, Carl Icahn.First-quarter earnings season is now in full swing. The Street is expecting a record season.Cramer helped callers quell their fears on a few key stocks.U.S. Steel:The company posts earnings on Thursday. But Cramer said he's not a buyer of the steel company. ""We like Nucor,"" he said on ""Mad Money"" Wednesday. Cramer said Nucor has great number, ""it just seems that people don't care.""Ball Corporation:""I think Ball's a big winner,"" Cramer said, pointing out that in the can industry, there are not a lot of players.Teva Pharmaceuticals:""Not good enough,"" Cramer said, comparing it with other drug companies.

"        How Carl Icahn came to join Herbalife's fight against Bill Ackman, igniting one of the biggest battles Wall Street has ever seen
			                 ",2018,04,24," By any standard, Jan. 25, 2013, began like any other for the thousands of traders, money managers and financiers making their way to Wall Street's canyons that morning, albeit with a snow-dusted commute — the first of the season.But by 1 p.m., it wasn't the wintry weather topping the tape, but a public brawl so outrageous and audacious that few could believe what had just taken place. For the better part of the previous hour, investing titans Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman had hurled insults at each other on live TV – my CNBC program — bringing trading to a near standstill in what some would call the greatest moment in the history of financial television.It would go on to become one of the biggest battles Wall Street had ever seen — a fight to the finish with the multilevel marketing company Herbalife caught in the middle. Ackman had massively shorted the stock, a billion-dollar bet that came with a bold claim. Herbalife was a pyramid scheme, he charged, whose stock was destined for the dumpster.Here's some of the backstory about the battle over Herbalife, whose CEO at the time was Michael Johnson. (Fair warning, the following excerpt contains some graphic language.)Michael Johnson was in church.It was Christmas Eve 2012, just days after Ackman made his presentation on Herbalife. The CEO had arrived early with one of his sons, hoping for something of a miracle—to save a dozen or so seats for family and friends who would join them for the pre‑holiday Mass in fifteen or twenty minutes. Standing in one of the pews, Johnson and his offspring tried their best to wave off the inquiring eyes, when his mobile phone rang.""No Caller ID"" read the screen.Thinking it was his wife calling, Johnson walked outside into the California night and hit the green ""Accept"" button on his iPhone.""Hi Michael, it's Carl Icahn,"" said the voice on the other end in a friendly and engaging tone. ""I don't get this Ackman thing.""Johnson had no idea how Icahn had gotten his number, but couldn't talk—his wife had just shown up and was waving for him to hang up.It wasn't a request.""But it's Carl Icahn . . . , it's Carl."" Johnson said, unable to even finish the sentence.Johnson sheepishly told Icahn he'd have to call him back the next day and hung up the phone, somewhat abruptly.The next afternoon, on Christmas, Johnson went to a quiet spot inside his Malibu mansion and dialed Icahn's number. Not one to beat around the bush, Icahn got right to the point."" 'I don't think this guy Ackman is right,' "" Johnson recalled Icahn saying. ""He said he was going to take advantage of that and get in on the other side.""Johnson had never met Icahn but knew of his tough‑as‑nails reputation. He also figured that having the iconic investor in his corner was a potential game‑changer in the fight with Ackman. It wasn't that Dan Loeb was chopped liver—he wasn't—but he also wasn't Icahn—a billionaire many times over who answered to no one. Plus, Icahn had something that Loeb didn't—staying power. Icahn's cash hoard, estimated to be nearly $20 billion at the time, was almost all his own, meaning he didn't have to worry about the interests of outside investors. Icahn's fiduciary responsibility was to Icahn himself. Icahn was also more than happy to mix it up anywhere, at any time, which Johnson knew could be a great asset against a guy like Ackman, who was loud in his own right. ""We had many people lined up against us that to have somebody lined up with us—it's a huge positive,"" said Johnson when we spoke about the development.The substance of the Icahn/Johnson call remained a secret until January 16, 2013, when a Wall Street Journal headline splashed across the paper's website. It simply read: ""Icahn Takes Herbalife Stake.""The Journal 's Juliet Chung reported that Icahn had taken what amounted to a ""small"" position in Herbalife and that he, or one of his associates, had recently met with the company's management.Despite the news, Herbalife shares fell 3.8 percent on the day to close at $45.06. Perhaps it was because most observers figured Icahn was simply along for the ride, content to ride shotgun on Herbalife with Chapman, Hempton, and especially Loeb, whom he had a great amount of respect for as an investor. It didn't take long for Icahn to make it clear that he had other plans.One week later, on the afternoon of January 24, Icahn appeared on the Bloomberg business TV network but refused to even discuss whether he'd bought any Herbalife shares.""I'm going to sort of duck that question,"" Icahn said coyly when asked by the show's host, Trish Regan, if he'd gone long on the stock. But while Icahn may have been reticent to talk about Herbalife directly, he didn't hold back when it came to Ackman himself and his over‑the‑top tactics.""Look, it's no secret to the world and to Wall Street—most guys on Wall Street I sort of like and get along with—it's no secret that I don't like Ackman. I don't respect him and I don't like him,"" said Icahn with stunning ease. ""But that doesn't mean that I'm going to go in and buy stock in a company necessarily just to get him—frankly I don't like the way he did this anyway. I think if you go short, you go short and hey if it goes down you make money—you don't go out and get a room full of people and badmouth the company. If you want to be in that business, why don't you just go join the SEC?""It was riveting television. Icahn lit into his nemesis in a barrage of insults.""I will tell you—I dislike the guy, I don't respect him—I've done business with him and he wasn't forthright,"" said Icahn before the segment ended.Icahn was alluding to the old Hallwood dispute, when he and Ackman had ended up in that ugly legal fight during the last days of Gotham. The beef ultimately cost Icahn $4.5 million on what the financier felt was a technicality. The ruling had enraged him, partly because of the hefty check he'd had to write, but also because of Ackman's attitude afterward. Ackman had gloated about the victory in the New York Times, which Icahn felt had violated a decades‑old code on Wall Street—never rub it in the other guy's face, no matter how gratifying the win.Icahn had never forgiven Ackman for it, and the reported Herbalife position, no matter how small it was said to be, had many wondering if his long‑awaited chance at payback had finally arrived.While Icahn was going after Ackman on television, I was strolling through CNBC's newsroom, when I stopped by the desk of a show producer named John Melloy, who was watching the spectacle on one of the four TV monitors atop his desk. Melloy ran the Halftime Report, which I hosted. Neither of us could get enough of what we were seeing. After the segment wrapped, I went back to my desk and impulsively emailed Ackman, whom I had never met before, asking if he wanted to respond to Icahn directly. I got my response later that evening, sitting at a table inside the lounge at the Surrey Hotel, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, waiting to have dinner with an acquaintance, thumbing through my emails to pass the time.A message from Ackman suddenly popped up, saying he was putting the finishing touches on a statement and would send it to me first, momentarily. It was pay dirt, I thought.A few seconds later, it appeared in my inbox:""On March 1, 2003, on behalf of my former fund, Gotham Partners, I entered into a contract with Carl Icahn, signed by him, to sell him a 15% stake in Hallwood Realty Partners. He paid my investors $80 per share and agreed to what he called ""schmuck insurance."" The agreement provided that he would pay my investors an earnout equal to 50% of his profit on Hallwood after he received a 10% annual return if he ""sold or otherwise transferred"" his shares for value within three years. Fewer than 13 months later on April 14, 2004, HRPT Property Trust acquired Hallwood. As a result, Carl and the other Hallwood shareholders received $136.16 per share in cash for their shares.""Under the terms of our agreement, Carl owed my investors about $4.5 million. He refused to pay. I was forced to sue him on behalf of my investors. On September 6, 2005, the court awarded us summary judgment and found the agreement to be ""clear and unambiguous."" He again refused to pay and appealed. We won on appeal and Carl was forced to post a bond for what he owed us and appealed again. In general, Carl waited to the last few days to appeal in order to delay the inevitable. After eight years and Carl's appeals of the judgment were denied, in 2011 the Court forced Carl to pay my investors the $4.5 million they were owed plus 9% interest per year from the date of the sale.""After Carl paid my investors, he called me up, congratulated me on winning, and said that he wanted to be my friend. I told him that I had no interest in being his friend.""Carl Icahn is a great investor, but, in my experience, he does not keep his word.""Within minutes, the release went public.""Bill Ackman Fires Back at Carl Icahn"" read the Business Insider headline that posted at 8:31 p.m. that night.I asked Ackman if he'd come on my show the following day at noon to personally respond to Icahn's so personal takedown. To my surprise, Ackman readily agreed.""Sure, I'd be happy to,"" he said.I emailed the show's producers, telling them of my coup. The stage was set—or so I thought.Not even five minutes after Ackman had agreed to come on my show, my phone rang again. Again, it was Ackman.""You know,"" he said, sounding exasperated by the evening's events, ""I'm not going to come on. This whole Icahn thing is a sideshow. I promise that I'll come on your show when I have something substantive to talk about.""""OK,"" I responded, as I tried to hide the obvious dejection. I headed back to dinner, where my friend was waiting, when my phone rang again. Once again, I excused myself and headed into the small hotel lobby when the voice on the other end said, ""Fuck it, I'll do it.""He didn't stop there. ""Carl's an asshole . . . he fucked me . . . he's a fucking asshole!""It was on.This article has been excerpted from ""When the Wolves Bite: Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle"" by Scott Wapner.

"        'The United States would be better off when Bill Ackman is gone' — Behind the investor's epic battle with Herbalife, Icahn
			                 ",2018,04,23," Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and his team had spent months preparing for the takedown of Herbalife – preparing hundreds of slides for the presentation which was now only days away.Herbalife had no idea what was coming.Then CEO Michael Johnson had helped build the business into a fast-growing juggernaut. Its stock price kept going higher and it sure looked like nothing could stand in its way. (Fair warning, the following excerpt contains some graphic language):With Hirsch on board, Ackman booked the AXA Center on Seventh Avenue. It was Ackman's go‑to venue and large enough to hold the hundreds of people he hoped would show up. Timing was the only question. When October came and went, Ackman pushed the presentation to the week of Thanksgiving. But when Dinneen still wasn't ready come November, Ackman set a drop‑dead date of December 20, just before many on Wall Street would take off for the holidays.With the date fast approaching and the presentation looming, Dinneen worked around the clock to prepare the hundreds of slides they'd need for the deck. If they were going to bring Herbalife down, everything had to be perfect, including making sure enough people actually showed up to see it.Ackman had a plan for that too.On December 19, the day before the Sohn special event, Ackman called CNBC's hedge‑fund reporter, Kate Kelly, to break the news about the big short. Kelly had a slew of big contacts in the industry and from Ackman's point of view was the perfect person to drop the bomb.Just before 2 p.m., Kelly busted into CNBC's regularly scheduled programming with the ""breaking news.""""I've just learned that Pershing Square hedge‑fund manager Bill Ackman has a major new short position in Herbalife,"" Kelly said, while producers in the control room threw up a stock chart to watch the reaction on Wall Street. ""Ackman considers Herbalife to be one of the single best investment short thesis he's ever seen from what we're hearing,"" said Kelly. ""He has been short Herbalife for about seven or eight months and will unveil more details why at the Sohn Conference tomorrow morning.""Boom.The Kelly scoop immediately sent Herbalife plunging, falling 15 percent within seconds. Three thousand miles away, inside Herbalife's Los Angeles headquarters, CEO Michael Johnson saw the slide and went apoplectic.""Who the fuck does this guy think he is,"" Johnson screamed to no one in particular, while a spokesperson with the company quickly drafted a statement blasting Ackman. Johnson continued his tirade. He was out for blood and didn't care who knew it. He also felt powerless to stop the stock's slide considering he was in Los Angeles and Ackman was in New York, where the story was just starting to spiral. Johnson wiped his schedule and called the Los Angeles offices of Moelis & Company, an investment bank that Johnson had done business with in the past. The firm's co-president, Navid Mahmoodzadegan, took the call. He knew Johnson well and urged the now frantic CEO to remain calm while the two figured out exactly what they were up against.Johnson would have none of it, arguing that he wasn't about to let some asshole back in New York ruin his company in a matter of minutes. So Johnson did the unthinkable. He picked up the phone and called into CNBC's Street Signs program and unloaded on Ackman in a tirade reflecting his outrage.""First of all, this is not about Herbalife's business model; this is about Bill Ackman's business model,"" Johnson railed into the phone, as Kelly and the program's host, Brian Sullivan, listened and watched the stock react in real‑time. ""This is wrong,"" Johnson said. ""This is totally wrong what is taking place. This is blatant market manipulation. We're not a pyramid scheme—that's a bogus accusation. We have millions of customers around the world. We don't pay for recruiting. We've been in business thirty‑two years. We just announced a hundred‑million‑dollar facility in North Carolina employing over five hundred people with the governor of North Carolina this morning. This is a legitimate company. Mr. Ackman's proposition that the United States would be better off when Herbalife is gone . . . The United States would be better off when Bill Ackman is gone.""Just like that, one of the biggest battles Wall Street had ever seen was on. Ackman watched Johnson's explosion live and was taken aback at how angry he appeared, even feeling threatened by the outburst. Johnson was pissed, so much so, as the rage was spilling from his body, that he'd jumbled Herbalife's sales figures in an exchange with the CNBC on‑air talent. Kelly had asked Johnson questions similar to those that Einhorn had asked about Herbalife's long‑controversial sales figures.Here's the transcript:Kelly: ""Mr. Johnson, questions have been raised by other major investors, including David Einhorn. Are the sales that go on about your products confined to your own distribution network? Is that the case, or is it broader than that?""Johnson: ""We have millions of customers. Our customers are sometimes called distributors; that's the only confusion that we have, and they are distributors because they get a discount on our products.""Kelly: ""Can you give us a percentage figure though Mr. Johnson as to what percentage of your sales are outside that distribution network?""Johnson: ""90%.""Kelly: ""So the vast majority?""Johnson: ""Absolutely.""The number was not accurate. Johnson had fucked up, and he knew it—not that there was anything he could about it now.Ackman pounced, claiming Johnson had lied.""He really sounded like a thug,"" Ackman remembers. ""It was clear to me that it was not the reaction of a normal CEO. He flat‑out lied.""This article has been excerpted from When the Wolves Bite: Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle by Scott Wapner. Copyright © 2018.

"        Herbalife prepared a 'secret dossier' on Bill Ackman as it geared up for fight with activist
			                 ",2018,04,20," Herbalife had just been hit with a haymaker.The hedge fund star Bill Ackman had taken to a stage in midtown Manhattan and accused the company of being a pyramid scheme, waging $1 billion that the company was a fraud. Shares plunged. The media went wild and some 3,000 miles away, inside the company's Los Angeles headquarters, CEO Michael Johnson was shell-shocked.Few inside the glass-enclosed bubble of Herbalife's HQ had even heard of Ackman, no less what he might be up to in calling the company out so publicly.It wanted to fight back, but how?First, they had to find out who they were truly dealing with....Herbalife Chief Executive Officer Michael O. Johnson had been waiting for weeks, hoping its arrival would help unmask the man who had threatened to destroy him. It was spring 2014, and the most closely followed multilevel marketing company on Earth was under siege.For the better part of eighteen months, Wall Street's resident rock star, the hedge‑fund manager William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management, had waged war against the company, burning through tens of millions of dollars of his firm's own money, with no end in sight.Ackman was tactical and tenacious, driven and determined, at times even obsessive in his torment, yet to the executive who'd spent the bulk of his time bobbing and weaving to avoid the onslaught, Ackman was, at the same time, bewildering.What drove him to attack so viciously, Johnson often wondered.What really made Ackman tick?One Sunday afternoon three weeks into May, some of that suspense was finally about to end, with the delivery of a document so sensitive its mere existence would be kept a secret until this writing. Even some of Herbalife's most senior leaders were initially kept from viewing it.The thirty‑page workup read like something out of a spy novel, but it wasn't a work of fiction. It was an in‑depth psychological profile of Ackman himself, the kind the FBI might do when chasing a hardened criminal. The secret dossier titled ""Preliminary Report on Bill Ackman"" described an adversary who was ""fiercely competitive"" and ""extremely smart,"" fueled by ambition and a quest to win at all costs.Herbalife's vice president of global security, Jana Monroe, had commissioned the effort with one goal in mind—to get inside Ackman's head, to uncover the who and why, his methods and motivation. ""My assessment early on was that he was going to be in this for the long haul,"" Monroe said of the report's critical findings. She was ""looking at his attacks on the company and figuring out where they might go so that we could be preemptive rather than reactive.""Monroe had spent thirty years in law enforcement, including more than twenty inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Five of those years were in the elite serial crime unit called the National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime, in Quantico, Virginia. A real‑life Clarice Starling, Monroe was on the teams investigating serial killers Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Dahmer, was an early reader of the Unabomber's notorious manifesto, and knew penetrating Ackman's mind would help the company understand the threat it was facing.""It was clear (from the report) that this was someone who wears his competitiveness on his sleeve—it's not just business, it's personal, it's me. I'm the one who knows how to make the right investments,"" said Monroe.The report was prepared by Dr. Park Dietz, one of the nation's leading forensic psychiatrists, a man who has spent decades profiling evil—from serial killers and stranglers to stalkers and school shooters. Dietz had never met Ackman before, but the Herbalife affair reminded him of the Tylenol tampering case from the 1980s and the incidents that followed—in particular one involving a man who shorted shares of a drug manufacturer then phoned in a hoax to drive the stock price lower.""Part of what interested me was the resemblance to a case that had fascinated me decades earlier,"" Dietz said. ""I always thought that was an interesting kind of crime.""But Dietz knew getting deep into Ackman's psyche would be difficult.Unlike most of his prior cases, he couldn't interview his subject and would instead have to scour the internet for old stories and television clips in order to study the major events of Ackman's life.""Most of it was journalistic,"" Dietz said. ""It was whatever was available—trying to look at his biography, the major newsworthy events and how he'd reacted to prior wins and losses. The task is to try and learn their life story with the available data and look for patterns in the behavior of that person in the life span.""Over dozens of highly descriptive pages, the document, which took nearly six weeks to prepare and cost Herbalife around $100,000 to commission, dissected Ackman and the characteristics that have made him the most famous financier on Wall Street—his history and tendencies, priorities and psychology.It described a man ""aggressive and competitive in all things,"" with a ""grandiose sense of self"" who ""craves association with other 'special' people and institutions.""""Greed would be an accurate descriptor,"" it read, ""but only because the number of digits followed by a dollar sign is a metric by which he measures his place in the world and expects others to measure him."" The document described Ackman as a person who ""requires constant admiration, adulation and publicity,"" who ""uses publicists and other contacts to shape and control press reports; chases celebrity and sees himself as a celebrity whose image is to be shaped and tailored by those loyal to him.""""My basic view was that he saw Herbalife as a target that offered him the potential to reap rewards for his investors while appearing to be a crusader for the downtrodden,"" said Dietz.""To me, he didn't seem to have much personal awareness,"" said Monroe of her own research. ""His performances weren't very convincing.""Line by line, the document tore Ackman open, depicting a merciless megalomaniac who ""uses philanthropy to deflect critics"" and is ""inclined to arrogant, haughty, disdainful, condescending, patronizing behavior and attitudes that he seeks to mask."" Ackman, it said, ""blames others for his defeats and mistakes"" and ""looks for loopholes in the law and ethics that he can exploit.""It threw shade on Ackman's uncanny resiliency, saying he ""believes he is in the right and stubbornly, inflexibly, sticks to his position."" He is ""very controlling,"" it read, ""and believes he can do most things better than anyone else in the room.""Another paragraph attacked Ackman's ability to deal with defeat, saying he is ""very sensitive to criticism and failure, which causes shame, humiliation, and rage, producing long‑remembered 'injuries,' but he always seems to have a bigger quest lined up to take his mind off the pain and distract others from the shame.""The report concluded with the following passage:""Ackman's public persona is an illusion manufactured to project onto a large screen his fantasies of unlimited success. As long as the public accepts the illusion, he can function, but he experiences any and all criticism or resistance as a threat to expose the insecure boy behind the curtain. He has no capacity to manage the feeling of shame that this creates, and he reacts to the feeling with rage.""By some measure, the document confirmed what Herbalife had believed from the beginning, but Johnson and his team thought building a more complete composite of the enemy would help determine the best way to fight back—what flanks to cover and how to manage the campaign.""We were trying to determine what his motivation was,"" said Herbalife's chief financial officer, John DeSimone. ""How we could get through this and what the endgame might be. We didn't know who Bill Ackman was—the man—the tactics and the strategy he might employ.""But beyond laying out a portrait of the enemy, the document also defined a road map for Herbalife to follow should the situation with Ackman suddenly—and dramatically—change.Under the headline ""Strategic Priorities,"" it advised Herbalife executives to ""keep open a door to genuine alliance"" with ground rules ""closely negotiated.""""If a path to engagement opens,"" it advised, ""appeal to Ackman's charitable persona by shifting his focus away from Herbalife's marketing and finances to the products. . . . Consider inviting Ackman to Herbalife to learn more about the business, the products, the people."" The report even suggested that ""Ackman would be drawn to a meeting that gave him a photo op and bragging rights for associating with someone he considers a bigger celebrity with the right image, perhaps President Obama, Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Jerry Bruckheimer, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Melinda Gates, Warren Buffett, or the current or most recent Presidents and Past Presidents of Harvard, Yale, or Princeton."" The document also recommended Herbalife ""see Ackman's highly public campaign for what it is: an opportunity to tell the world about (the company).""""Create a big, positive narrative around (CEO) Michael Johnson,"" it recommended. ""THIS is the good guy. . . . Convey his energy, enthusiasm, and vision for Herbalife.""It advised Herbalife to ""right‑size the threat"" and to ""keep the focus away from Ackman personally and on the substance of his criticism. Any publicity centered on Ackman, even negative publicity, can play into his public persona as an 'activist shareholder.' ""The battle with Ackman had consumed the company since December 2012, when Ackman had first laid out his stunning case and his billion‑dollar short. Now—finally—for the very first time, Johnson and Herbalife's other executives felt they could begin to understand why the war had happened in the first place.It was a war that began with little more than a phone call.This article has been excerpted from ""When the Wolves Bite: Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle"" by Scott Wapner.

"        Bill Ackman says Newell made 'deal with the devil' in Icahn agreement
			                 ",2018,04,17," Pershing Square Capital Management's Bill Ackman said Sharpie pen maker Newell Brands made a kind of ""deal with the devil"" in appointing Carl Icahn's board picks in March.""The company was so afraid of losing a proxy contest that they made a deal with the devil, so to speak,"" Ackman said Tuesday, quickly clarifying that he ""meant that in the most positive way.""""What Carl's doing here is he's basically been given control of Newell,"" Ackman added. ""He's got five seats on the board or something like that: his son, a whole bunch of affiliates, not the kind of board I think this audience would elect for its independence necessarily.""News of Icahn's board appointments at Newell last month came just days after he disclosed a 6.86 percent stake in the company and said he could seek a board seat at the consumer products company. His designated directors are Patrick Campbell, Brett Icahn, Andrew Langham and Courtney Mather.""They got [the board seats] by negotiation, Carl's style of negotiation, and just leveraging off the fact that another activist ran a full slate for the company,"" Ackman said. He delivered his comments at the 13D Monitor Active-Passive Investor Summit in New York on Tuesday.In addition to the bid from Icahn, Newell has also been challenged by rival activist shareholder, Starboard Value, which wants to replace Newell's CEO and its entire board. Starboard has argued that the company has underperformed since buying Jarden Corp. two years ago.""We do believe that there is incredible value at Newell. It's a company with iconic brands. It's brands that we all heard of [such as] Elmer's glue, Sharpie, Paper Mate,"" said Starboard CEO Jeff Smith in an interview with David Faber at the conference on Tuesday. ""It's a great company [with] great employees. Unfortunately, it's lost its way.""Smith revealed in a filing last week his hedge fund is also seeking four board seats at Newell, potentially putting the firm at odds with Icahn.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/17/bill-ackman-says-newell-made-deal-with-the-devil-in-icahn-agreement.html

"        Bill Ackman’s hedge fund empire is tumbling...
			                 ",2018,04,05," Bill Ackman has seen his hedge fund's assets cut more than in half from their peak above $20 billion in 2015 as institutional investors flee Pershing Square's abysmal returns amid a roaring bull market.Most of the outside investors have departed as restrictions have lifted, a person familiar with the matter told CNBC. The defectors include longtime partner Blackstone Group.Pushing them out the door is an 8.6 percent negative return this year through the end of March, which followed a 4 percent losing return in 2017. Total assets now total just $8.2 billion.The fund had a negative return of 13.5 percent in 2016 and negative 20.5 percent in 2015. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up 11 percent annually the last three years.Pershing Square declined to comment for this story. News of the institutional investor exit was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.Some of Pershing's challenges over the past three years included a $4 billion loss on its stake in Valeant Pharmaceuticals. Ackman's short of nutritional supplement company Herbalife proved costly not only in money lost, but also in reputation because of the high profile battle over the company with Carl Icahn.Pershing also remains the largest investor in Chipotle Mexican Grill with a 10.3 percent stake in the company, according to FactSet. While that investment remains a loss for the fund, Chipotle shares have rallied 26 percent since the restaurant appointed Brian Niccol as chief executive, a move Pershing has celebrated. Niccol took over last month.Ackman earlier this year cut one-fifth of Pershing Square Capital staff, including one investment professional and several operational positions, as outside investors fled the fund. Reuters earlier reported the layoffs and said Ackman intends to reduce his time in the public sphere, opting instead to focus on investing.Pershing has clinched some modest investing victories over the past year, including $100 million profit from its brief stake in Nike. CNBC reported in January that Pershing Square started buying Nike in October when it was trading in the $52 to $53 per share range, according to a source.Ackman's hedge fund woes are not alone. Several high-profile funds have disappointed in recent years, including David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital and Nelson Peltz's Trian Fund Management, which posted gains of just 1.6 percent and 3.7 percent respectively last year. Einhorn told clients earlier this week that the fund suffered one of its worst quarters.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/05/how-bill-ackmans-hedge-fund-empire-crumbled-in-less-than-three-years.html

"        Hedge-fund managers that do the most research will post the best returns, study suggests
			                 ",2018,03,20," For investors, it appears doing your homework does trump dumb luck.Hedge funds that frequently accessed SEC filings such as annual reports posted better-than-average returns in the following month compared with non-users, according to a new academic study.The working paper from Rice University finds that funds accessing one or more SEC filings in a month exhibit 1.5 percent higher annualized abnormal returns in the subsequent month and that above-median users generate 2 percent higher returns per year.""The fact that public information acquisition relates to performance is surprising. SEC filings are the very definition of 'public' information, and therefore, usage of such information should not be profitable,"" wrote researchers Alan Crane, Kevin Crotty and Tarik Umar. ""Overall, our results are less consistent with the view that hedge funds have a processing advantage and more consistent with the view that public information complements private signals.""By mapping hedge fund internet protocol (IP) addresses to those accessing financial filings at the SEC, the team identified public information acquisition by hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, PanAgora and AQR. Perhaps most surprising, the researchers found the median fund-month download amount is only four filings while the mean was 672, suggesting that relatively few funds are accessing vastly more information. Source: Crane, Crotty & Umar (2018) Variation in the use of public information also differed widely across and within hedge funds, as well as by type of filing. For an average fund-month, financial statements comprise roughly 33 percent of total downloads, while 8-K disclosures (major event announcements) account for another 20 percent.Renaissance Technologies and BlackRock were among the top users of filings on the government's Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval system, the researchers said, with over 3.7 million EDGAR downloads each since 2003.Of course, the Rice University researchers are not the first group to have questioned if hedge funds are really doing their homework.A 2017 Notre Dame study found that the average firm's annual report is requested only 28.4 times through the EDGAR database. A February 2018 study by Yale and AQR found that hedge funds trade more aggressively — and more profitably — in stocks with less sell-side analyst coverage, when greater information asymmetry benefits sophisticated investors.The Rice paper comes as some of the country's renowned fund managers known for doing their homework struggle for the historically high returns to which they're accustomed. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital fund, for example, returned just 1.6 percent in 2017, while Bill Ackman's Pershing Square lost 4 percent over the year, according to its website.Einhorn explained that his fund's underperformance was the result of a temporary market issue, while some have speculated that the rise of computerized trading has taken much of the low-hanging, numbers-based valuation opportunities away. In other words, publicly available information may be better disseminated thanks to automation.""Despite it being a good year in the market, it was a challenging environment for our investment style,"" Einhorn wrote to clients in February. ""We have a value orientation and we take comfort from the margin of safety afforded by the low valuations of our long investments … while we certainly don't believe value investing is dead, it is clearly out of favor at the moment.""To be sure, the SEC's website and EDGAR database is just one avenue through which financial documents are accessed; investors may use software such as the Bloomberg Terminal or FactSet to view filings, while others may navigate to a company's investor relations page instead of trying to navigate the comparatively confusing government site. Despite that, EDGAR is likely a better option for funds that employ robotic or automated programming, the researchers told CNBC.""These findings represent usage through the SEC, so we can't observe whether you went through somewhere else,"" Crane told CNBC. But ""the SEC is one of the easiest options if you're doing this with some sort of programming or Python script,"" allowing funds with high-level programming language to harvest — or ""scrape"" — massive amounts of data from the government website.But just how the added public information benefits the funds remains in question.For their part, the Rice researchers argued that while it's tempting to conclude that sophisticated hedge-fund managers are simply more skilled at processing swaths of information and data, their advantage may be more in their ability to match private data with public disclosures and SEC filings.""We look at the people who do robotic downloading. The people who use it suggests that hedge funds are going out and that they're getting public information whenever they need,"" Umar told CNBC. ""Hedge funds get satellite data, all sorts of hard-to-get information in addition to public filings, and it's difficult to tease out"" the specific benefit from added SEC data.Instead, Umar said, it's likely funds combine both public and specialized information while investing, using one to reinforce the other.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/20/doing-your-homework-does-lead-to-better-investing-returns.html

"        Martin Shkreli's legacy: Putting a 'fine point' on the drug pricing debate
			                 ",2018,03,09," Martin Shkreli gained a number of monikers in his rise to infamy. Pharma Bro. Most hated man in America. Face of corporate greed.Executives in the drug industry call him something else: catalyst.""He was, in the great scheme of things, a drop in the bucket,"" said Ron Cohen, CEO of biotech company Acorda Therapeutics and past chair of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization industry group. ""But he created such a massive impression and blowback that it forced entire industries, government, patient advocacy groups, the media and political entities all to focus on these issues in a way that I don't know that they would have absent that event.""The nearly three-year saga that saw Shkreli come to prominence as a pharmaceutical CEO, raise the price of a 60-year-old medicine by 5,000 percent, purchase a single-copy Wu-Tang Clan album for $2 million, get arrested on unrelated charges of securities fraud, troll America, get convicted, and be sent to prison in a bizarre set of circumstances involving Hillary Clinton's hair follicles ostensibly came to an end Friday, when he was sentenced by a federal judge to seven years in prison.But his actions — at least those involving pharmaceutical pricing — had an impact that persists, those in the drug industry say, from spurring a conversation about the complexities of drug pricing, to priming the pump for drug pricing scandals that followed, to illuminating inefficiencies in the generic drug market.""There's no question that pricing has been on the mind of people for several years; Shkreli put a fine point on it,"" said Jeff Jonas, CEO of Sage Therapeutics. ""Access to medicines remains an important social issue for our time.""But Shkreli's unique ability to capture and cling to the public's attention vaulted the focus on drug prices to another level, said Peter Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering.""Shkreli was a perfect item for the media,"" Bach said. ""If this had been a couple of quiet accountants with a hedge fund that had done this, and when they got called, their answer was 'No comment,' or the usual, 'Our pricing reflects — take your pick — the value of our products to patients, the cost of innovation, unmet need, cost savings, whatever — I think it wouldn't be a story.""But Shkreli doubled down, infamously saying at the Forbes Healthcare Summit just before his arrest in December 2015 that if he could change anything he'd done, he'd have raised the price of the drug in question — called Daraprim — even further.""My shareholders expect me to make the most profit,"" Shkreli said onstage at the time. ""That's the ugly, dirty truth.""So how can Shkreli's impact be measured? One clear metric is the stock market. News of his 5,000 percent price increase on Daraprim — from $13.50 a pill to $750 — in September 2015 prompted then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to tweet about a forthcoming plan to stop such ""price gouging.""Biotech stocks swiftly sank 5 percent — a move so closely tied to Shkreli's action that some questioned whether he'd somehow masterminded the whole event to profit from shorting the sector. The group didn't begin its recovery until the following autumn.But Shkreli had created an environment that shined a spotlight on others playing a similar game.""The Shkreli incident primed the pump,"" Cohen said. ""You had all these different branches of society, not least the media, looking for examples, looking for places where they could unearth similar behavior or analogous instances.""One was at drug company Valeant, which in the summer of 2015 was trading at more than $250 a share before questions arose about its business practices. The questions included its strategy of acquiring old medicines and dramatically raising their prices, as featured in a prominent story in the New York Times.""That was a big deal,"" Bach recalled.Valeant's former management team was hauled in front of Congress in April 2016, along with shareholder Bill Ackman of Pershing Square, to answer questions about the pricing practices. Further questions about its business model sent the stock into a tailspin, and it bottomed out below $10 a share last year.Meanwhile, another pricing scandal was brewing, this one of a different nature: Mylan's slow but steady increase in the price of the EpiPen, the epinephrine auto-injector used in the event of an allergy attack, by a cumulative 400 percent over a decade.It was during 2016's back-to-school season — a time when parents often stock up on the devices, which expired every year, to send with their kids to school — that Mylan grabbed headlines. CEO Heather Bresch responded by starting a new national conversation about drug prices: pointing a finger at the middlemen who she said contributed to rising prices.""No one's more frustrated than me,"" Bresch told CNBC at the time.Bresch drew pharmacy benefit managers and the rest of the drug supply chain into the controversies over pricing, changing the discussion to one embraced by the rest of the pharmaceutical industry.""In the end, I think it led to a substantial heightening of awareness of how this whole system works,"" Cohen said.Pharmacy benefits managers came under pressure — particularly Express Scripts as it was the only free-standing company in the group. This week health insurer Cigna announced it would buy the company for $67 billion.The supply chain also became a focus of the Trump administration's efforts to target drug prices, one of a number of ways government entities have responded to the national outcry.FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb cited ""pernicious"" rebating and contracting schemes in a speech this week about market access to cheaper copies of biotech drugs called biosimilars. And he's focused attention on the generic drug space, moving to streamline approvals and publishing a list of drugs vulnerable to Shkreli-like actions: those that have lost patent protection but have no generic competition.""We don't play a role in drug pricing, but we do affect drug competition in terms of getting new drugs onto the market, and create competition to older drugs, particularly with generic drugs,"" Gottlieb told CNBC at the time.Shkreli helped draw attention to those exploitable issues in the generic drug space, said Jonas.""This basically appeared to be a moneymaking scheme that took advantage of the inefficiencies in the approval of generics,"" he said of Shkreli's move. ""The only positive was that he drew attention to the complexity of the"" system.So have drug price increases stopped, or slowed? Yes and no.""Shkreli's actions did call attention to list prices — a drug's price before rebates and other discounts,"" said Adam Fein, CEO of Drug Channels Institute. Before 2014, Fein said, list prices had been growing by 10 to 15 percent annually.""Since then, list price growth has slowed,"" he said, noting a number of pledges from drug company CEOs to limit increases to less than 10 percent a year. ""I expect average brand-name list price growth to be 7 to 10 percent over the next few years.""Growth after rebates and discounts has been climbing ""in the low single digits"" for the past few years, Fein said.But large increases still happen. Last month alone, Wells Fargo analyst David Maris tracked the 50 biggest price increases on medicines, the largest of which was a 948.4 percent increase on a drug from Torrent Pharmaceuticals. And data from Rx Savings Solutions show price increases of less than 10 percent on expensive medicines can result in adding thousands of dollars to their cost.Source: Wells Fargo/MediSpan PriceRxIncreases of 9 percent on the average wholesale price of Celgene's cancer medicines Pomalyst and Revlimid, for example, added more than $4,000, the data show.""Shkreli played a pretty simple game: Raise the price and juice the profit,"" said Michael Rea, CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. ""But there are price changes that happen that yield far greater profit than anything that Shkreli did.""Biotech bristles at Shkreli's insinuation he's one of the group.""He was in a different business,"" said Stelios Papadopoulos, chairman of biotech giant Biogen. ""People need to appreciate what he's being sentenced for has nothing to do with his activities with regards to drug pricing — and even his drug pricing has nothing to do with what people do in the drug business, who invest hundreds of millions of dollars to discover drugs.""""I see him as essentially a hedge fund manager,"" Cohen added.The seven years Shkreli was sentenced to for his conviction on three counts including securities fraud, having to do with hedge funds he ran and a former biotech company, Retrophin, that he founded before Turing, was significantly higher than the 18-month request made by defense attorneys. But it was shorter than the 15 years requested by government prosecutors.He will get credit for the six months he has already spent in jail. After his release, Shkreli will be on probation for three years.He also will need to pay a $75,000 fine, and will be barred from holding a majority stake in a company or serving as an executive or director. ""Shkreli has no lasting impact on biotech,"" said Evonne Sepsis, an industry investment banker at ESC Advisors. ""Biotech's focus has been and continues to be on cutting-edge research and development and innovation to deliver therapies to patients.""Still, said Bach, the conversation around pricing has changed since Shkreli burst on the scene.""If we do get a transformation, which I think we're going to get,"" Bach said — referring to a move toward tying drug prices to outcomes measures, ""and the book is written about how all this happened, he gets a chapter for sure.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/09/martin-shkrelis-legacy-shaping-the-drug-pricing-debate.html
"        Citi predicts a big rally for Herbalife now that risk of Ackman bashing is over
			                 ",2018,03,06," Herbalife shares will rise because investors can now focus on the nutritional supplement maker's growth prospects rather than on negative headlines, according to one Wall Street firm.Pershing Square's Bill Ackman told CNBC on Feb. 28 he exited his losing bet against Herbalife, five years after his on-air verbal brawl with Carl Icahn over the company. Icahn said the following day he made a billion dollar paper profit on his investment in the company.Citi Research raised its rating to buy from neutral for Herbalife shares, citing the company's attractive valuation versus the market.""Even with the rise in the stock, we see upside as Herbalife executes a tender offer and refinances its debt, to both reinvest in the business and repurchase shares in 2019,"" analyst Beth Kite wrote in a note to clients Monday. We ""expect Ackman's exit may mean that some investors give Herbalife a new look as headline risk has dissipated, we contend that Herbalife should trade at a 10% premium to the market.""The company's stock is up 39 percent this year through Monday. Herbalife shares rose 2.5 percent Tuesday.Kite increased her price target for Herbalife shares to $114 from $85, representing 21 percent upside to Monday's close.Herbalife currently trades at a 9 percent price-to-earnings multiple discount to the S&P 500, according to the analyst's estimates. Kite said the company traded at an 8 percent premium to the market in 2010 and 2011 before Ackman publicized his bearish position.""From a fundamental point of view, if Herbalife can deliver its local currency sales growth guidance in 2018, it would be one of the best top line stories in HPC [Household/Personal Care Products],"" she wrote.— CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/06/citi-predicts-a-big-rally-for-herbalife-now-the-risk-of-ackman-bashing-it-is-over.html
"        Carl Icahn: My biggest stock market worry is 'creeping inflation,' not a potential trade war
			                 ",2018,03,01," Billionaire investor Carl Icahn told CNBC on Thursday that he focuses on ""simplistic, but obvious things"" when trying to gauge the direction of the stock market, especially during these highly volatile times.Ignore all the day-to-day headlines out of Washington, he said on ""Fast Money Halftime Report,"" even as equities  on concerns about a trade war after President Donald Trump announced steel and aluminum tariffs.""I'm not concerned about a trade war,"" Icahn said. ""I think the major thing you have to worry about and think about is creeping inflation.""""If you have creeping inflation, I think you're going to have higher interest rates, which I think might be difficult to deal with for the market,"" he added.That's exactly what sparked the stock market correction last month: a higher-than-expected average hourly earnings number in January's jobs report ignited fears that inflation might finally be coming to life, and in response the Federal Reserve may look to hike rates more aggressively than the three projected increases for this year.For its part, the bond market has certainly not been waiting for the Fed, with traders recently pushing the yield on the 10-year Treasury to four-year highs before backing off a bit.""I do not really think, especially at this time — I don't say this facetiously — that anybody really knows which way this market is going to go on a short-term basis. I really think there are too many variables,"" Icahn said. ""I think you have to have a hedged position for somebody who's got a major position.""The tax reform law championed by Trump and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill also has been a scapegoat for Wall Street strategists trying to explain the market swings. The narrative goes that tax relief on top of an already-strengthening economy will also stoke inflation and all the negative consequences that come with it.But Icahn, an early supporter of Trump and later a one-time informal advisor to the president, said he believes the benefits of the tax overhaul, especially the federal corporate rate cut from 35 percent to 21 percent will be more positive for the economy than negative in the long run.""The tax cuts I think are positive because I think the more money you have outside of the spending ability of Washington the better. In other words, I don't believe in big government,"" he said. ""My whole philosophy is entrepreneurship"" and how companies, when allowed to keep more of their profits, will deploy capital in more constructive ways than government, he added.The chairman of Icahn Enterprises, who has been investing in the market for four decades, often targets struggling companies as an activist in hopes of bringing about changes to boost the market value of their stocks and improve their businesses.Icahn also told CNBC on Thursday that he has made $1 billion on paper on his long bet on Herbalife, a company that fellow hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman bet against and recently closed his disastrous position entirely. Icahn also said he has a large stake in Rubbermaid maker Newell, calling the stock ""undervalued.""Disclaimer",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/01/carl-icahn-my-biggest-stock-market-worry-is-creeping-inflation.html

You've already made the call during a calmer, non-battle-oriented moment — you're just waiting for lower prices to give you a better entry point.""Cramer said that one main reason for market volatility is that major institutional firms are jumping in and out of stocks based on data points that may not be totally accurate.But those position changes move the needle, leading to sell-offs like the one earlier this week that was spurred by rising Treasury rates and prolonged by concerns over the future of health care costs.So, during market-wide volatility, Cramer steers investors towards secular growth stocks, groups of equities that have bright futures regardless of the day-to-day market action.After a year of an often unpredictable administration, Cramer was heartened to see President Donald Trump deliver a measured, predictable State of the Union address.""It's ironic, but this president does, indeed, know what the stock market wants from him: it wants cheerleading, more defense dollars, less regulation, especially when it comes to big business, and, of course, lower taxes,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.Trump gave investors a bullish take on the market layout, touting the $8 trillion in stock market value added since the election, pledging more defense spending and talking up a $1.5 trillion infrastructure plan.Given the optimism, Cramer broke down the speech into actionable parts so investors could get in on the ""rhetoric per share.""Automatic Data Processing President and CEO Carlos Rodriguez and activist investor Bill Ackman have resolved their differences since Ackman lost a proxy fight against the payroll giant, Rodriguez said Wednesday.""It's all water under the bridge,"" the CEO told CNBC in an interview with Cramer. ""We listened very carefully to what Bill had to say. In fact, I've been in touch with him, so we have, I think, what I would call a collegial and professional relationship.""In an August 2017 interview with CNBC, Rodriguez slammed Ackman, saying the Pershing Square chief reminded him of a ""spoiled brat."" In November, Ackman slammed back, calling ADP ""very inefficient.""The battle ostensibly came to an end when Ackman lost his bid for a seat on ADP's board, though he remained a shareholder. And on Wednesday, Rodriguez brushed the contentious back-and-forth under the rug.Chubb's 2016 merger with ACE Limited has paid off better than Chubb Chairman and CEO Evan Greenberg ever expected, he told CNBC on Wednesday in an interview with Cramer.""We exceeded our initial expectations by a mile on efficiencies and cost take-out, but it's really about one plus one equals three,"" Greenberg said of the newly integrated insurance giant. ""We are growing faster today than I believe the two companies left on their own would.""Citing ""the complementary strengths of the two organizations in terms of product capability and service strengths and geographic reach and distribution excellence,"" Greenberg said the market opportunity still ahead of the company was ""compelling.""And when it comes to broader global concerns like climate change that insurers may need to hedge against in the future, Greenberg said it was Chubb's duty as a company to tackle the issues.""As long as we can be paid properly and we can understand the risk and we can structure the risk, we will assume that risk,"" Greenberg said. ""As climate change becomes a greater reality and we have more volatility and as society … becomes more affluent, urbanizes more, then there's greater concentrations in exposure. That's the insurance industry's job if we want to remain relevant.""In Cramer's lightning round, he shared his take on some callers' favorite stocks:Energy Transfer Partners LP: ""I am shocked they increased the distribution and I've got to tell you, I no longer hate the stock. Now I'm getting lukewarm on it.""Square, Inc.: ""Square is about as speculative as you can get, and I would say I would only hold it if I was willing to lose at least 10 to 15 percent of my capital within three days. Of course, you could make it, too, but that's not my cup of tea and I don't want you to violate your rules.""Questions for Cramer?

""You can always move a little bit faster, so there's nothing wrong with someone pushing us to move quicker and have a little more of a sense of urgency.""For Rodriguez, the results speak for themselves. Just this morning, ADP delivered a strong earnings beat on the top and bottom lines and raised guidance due to a number of economic tailwinds.""As a matter of fact, [Ackman] did call to congratulate me"" on winning the proxy fight in November, Rodriguez told Cramer. ""I think it's a good, productive relationship now.""Rodriguez also said that the current economic environment is ""practically perfect"" for ADP, the country's largest payroll processor.The company's high effective tax rate will be reduced by corporate tax cuts, raising the potential for a dividend boost for ADP. In addition, better economic activity, slightly higher inflation and rising interest rates are all boons for the administrative colossus, the CEO said.Rodriguez said that ADP's data is also signaling wage inflation, another positive economic catalyst.But the CEO was focused on a broader trend that is changing what many consider to be the fabric of the American workforce.""The nature of the workforce is changing and gig workers are one of the factors,"" Rodriguez said. ""The most popular image that people have of that is Uber and people kind of working on the side, but it's really across the whole economy. There's approximately 35 million people who work as independent contractors or get a 1099, and ... they need help in terms of compliance, they need help with managing their finances, and the employers who use them as independent contractors need that help as well.

			                 ",2018,01,26," Bill Ackman's Pershing Square has taken a passive stake in Nike, a source tells CNBC.The activist hedge fund will not pressure the shoe apparel company for changes, the source said. CNBC was not able to clarify the size of the hedge fund's position in Nike. Pershing Square started buying Nike in October when it was trading in $52 to $53 per share range, according to a source. The stock closed at $67.71 Thursday.Ackman's new stake was earlier reported by Reuters, which said it revealed at the firm's annual client dinner Thursday. Nike shares are up 8 percent this month and have a market value of nearly $110 billion. The passive investment fits with a sort of retreat from the public eye taking place right now by Ackman, the normally vocal activist. Reuters reported on Monday that Pershing Square is laying off 10 employees, representing nearly a fifth of its total staff. The hedge fund manager plans to spend more time investing and will stop marketing and public relations efforts, according to the report.It has been a difficult three years for Pershing Square's investors. The hedge fund's returns fell 4 percent in 2017, dropped 13.5 percent in 2016 and declined 20.5 percent in 2015, according to its website.Nike shares are up 0.8 percent Friday morning.— CNBC's Leslie Picker and Scott Wapner contributed to this story.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/26/normally-vocal-hedge-fund-manager-bill-ackman-takes-a-passive-stake-in-nike.html

			                 ",2018,01,18," When CNBC's Jim Cramer evaluates retail companies and their stocks, he likes to go straight to the source.""I shop everywhere and if I shop at a place that I'm not that crazy about, I don't recommend the stock. And I'm not crazy about shopping at J.C. Penney,"" the ""Mad Money"" host told a caller on Thursday. ""The people are very nice. I just don't find it a very satisfactory experience. So I can't recommend the stock.""Even so, Thursday's broad declines in the major averages didn't stop Cramer from noticing some unusual, positive action in individual stocks.""I'm talking about these multi-day-up extravaganzas, where investors can't buy enough shares in one session after a positive event so they keep coming back, day after day after day, to get their full positions on, no matter how much the stock runs in the interim,"" Cramer said. ""Honestly, I have never seen anything like it, so I've got to point this out and explain it to you.""Blockchain, a digital record-keeping method that exploded in popularity in conjunction with the cryptocurrency craze, will change the way the world makes transactions, IBM's Martin Schroeter told CNBC on Thursday after earnings.""If you bought IBM stock today, you would have to wait three days for that to clear because it has to go through its process,"" Schroeter, IBM's senior vice president of global markets, told Cramer. ""In a blockchain, ... you can see every transaction instantly, so your trade could clear and go from their account to your account instantly.""But blockchain isn't all about trading, and certainly not all about trading cryptocurrencies, Schroeter, former CFO of IBM, told Cramer. (Schroeter took on his new role, once held by IBM CEO Ginni Rometty, on Jan. 11, ceding the CFO role to IBM veteran James Kavanaugh.)Having recently partnered with shipping colossus Maersk on a joint venture to apply blockchain software, IBM hopes to establish an efficient ""global trade network"" of manufacturers, shippers, freight forwarders and others, Schroeter said.To Cramer, the story of this stock market seems to be all about ""cognitive dissonance.""""There's just so many examples of investors holding two contradictory opinions at the same time and it has a tendency to color the tape,"" the ""Mad Money"" host.Cramer's top four contradictions? Rates, Trump, cryptocurrencies and the stock shortage, he said.Automakers are racing to develop self-driving cars, but the benefits of the trend stretch beyond autos, PPG Industries Chairman and CEO Michael McGarry told Cramer on Thursday.""If you think about the LIDAR and radar that enables autonomous driving, they need to have the costs driven down so this can become a ubiquitous technology,"" McGarry said.As the chief of one of the world's largest makers of paints and coatings, McGarry said his company was seizing on the opportunity to help these automakers drive down their costs with his products.""Coatings will help them enable that technology to work with [fewer] radar and LIDAR units because it'll make the car more visible,"" McGarry told Cramer. ""We can put the LIDAR and radar in the bumpers so they can not be so ugly on the car. So if you think about why the Tesla 3 has such great visibility is because it has the ability to hide a lot of things, and we can enable that.""""We're certainly pleased to be a leading partner with [Tesla],"" the CEO added.In Cramer's lightning round, he zoomed through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:Vale: ""Look, it's $13.

"        BlackRock’s message to Corporate America: Contribute to society, or risk losing our support
			                 ",2018,01,16," On Tuesday, the chief executives of the world's largest public companies will be receiving a letter from one of the most influential investors in the world. And what it says is likely to cause a firestorm in the corner offices of companies everywhere and a debate over social responsibility that stretches from Wall Street to Washington.Laurence D. Fink, founder and chief executive of the investment firm BlackRock, is going to inform business leaders that their companies need to do more than make profits — they need to contribute to society as well if they want to receive the support of BlackRock.Mr. Fink has the clout to make this kind of demand: His firm manages more than $6 trillion in investments through 401(k) plans, exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, making it the largest investor in the world, and he has an outsize influence on whether directors are voted on and off boards.More from The New York Times:  Oil Briefly Reaches $70 as Buoyant Global Economy Bolsters DemandBP to Take $1.7 Billion Charge Over Deepwater Horizon SpillChinese Carmaker May Use Fiat Chrysler for Foothold in United States""Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose,"" he wrote in a draft of the letter that was shared with me. ""To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.""It may be a watershed moment on Wall Street, one that raises all sorts of questions about the very nature of capitalism. ""It will be a lightning rod for sure for major institutions investing other people's money,"" said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at the Yale School of Management and an expert on corporate leadership. ""It is huge for an institutional investor to take this position across its portfolio.'' He said he's seen ""nothing like it.''In a candid assessment of what's happening in the business world — and perhaps taking a veiled shot at Washington at the same time — Mr. Fink wrote that he is seeing ""many governments failing to prepare for the future, on issues ranging from retirement and infrastructure to automation and worker retraining."" He added, ""As a result, society increasingly is turning to the private sector and asking that companies respond to broader societal challenges.""It is a refrain that we're hearing more and more from various pockets of the business community, and in fact last year company leaders found themselves taking stands on issues like immigration policy, race relations, gay rights and more.But for the world's largest investor to say it aloud — and declare that he plans to hold companies accountable — is a bracing example of the evolution of corporate America. Mr. Fink says he is adding staff to help monitor how companies respond; only time will tell whether BlackRock truly uses his firm's heft to influence new social initiatives.Part of Mr. Fink's argument rests on the changing mood of the country regarding social responsibility. He contends that if a company doesn't engage with the community and have a sense of purpose ""it will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders.""Companies often talk about contributing to society — sometimes breathlessly — but it is typically written off as a marketing gimmick aimed at raising profits or appeasing regulators.Mr. Fink's declaration is different because his constituency in this case is the business community itself. It pits him, to some degree, against many of the companies that he's invested in, which hold the view that their only duty is to produce profits for their shareholders, an argument long espoused by economists like Milton Friedman.""What does it mean to say that 'business' has responsibilities? Only people can have responsibilities,"" Friedman wrote, almost rhetorically, back in 1970 in this very newspaper. ""Businessmen who talk this way are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society these past decades.""Until recently, companies like BlackRock have traditionally been passive investors and have done little to pressure the leaders of companies they invested in; in fact they were known for rubber stamping management's plans. It was active investors who sought to hold companies accountable — either by agitating for change or by selling their shares to express their displeasure.Indeed, Mr. Fink has in the past denounced ""activist"" shareholders as too focused on the short term. ""If you asked me if activism harms job creation, the answer is yes,"" he told me back in 2014. Now he is changing his stripes.Over the past two years, for example, BlackRock quietly became a thorn in the side of Exxon. In 2016, the firm withheld support from two directors as a protest against Exxon's ""non-engagement"" policy, which barred independent board members from meeting with shareholders like Mr. Fink. Then, in 2017, BlackRock supported a shareholder proposal to enhance the company's disclosures on climate, in part because Exxon's policy prevented the firm from getting a full understanding of its long-term strategy and risk exposure.The climate disclosure proposal ultimately passed, and just last month Exxon agreed to publish climate impact reports. Perhaps even more notably, Exxon also changed its policy of non-engagement, and now permits meetings between shareholders and independent directors.BlackRock has even begun siding with activist investors themselves, something it hasn't publicized. One of its funds voted in favor of the activist Nelson Peltz last year in his proxy fight with Procter & Gamble. It also voted in favor of Bill Ackman against ADP. BlackRock voted in favor of activist-led proposals in 19 percent of proxy fights last year and that number is likely to rise.In a surprising twist, even activist investors are taking up social causes. Jana Partners and Calstrs, the huge California retirement system that manages the pensions of the state's public schoolteachers, wrote a letter to Apple last week demanding that it focus more on the detrimental effects its products may have on children.The chief executive of Whole Foods, John Mackey, once referred to Jana as ""greedy bastards"" when the firm was attacking him. But here was Jana espousing the importance of issues like public health, human capital management and environmental protection, and saying that ""companies pursuing business practices that make short-term sense may be undermining their own long-term viability.""""In the case of Apple,"" Jana wrote, ""we believe the long-term health of its youngest customers and the health of society, our economy, and the company itself, are inextricably linked."" (Side note: It isn't clear why Jana went after Apple, considering that it has better tools to manage the use of its products by children than anyone else in the industry; but the general idea of technology companies paying more attention to children's health is a good one.)Mr. Fink makes a point in his letter that the recent corporate tax cut could bring out the kind of activist investors he once denounced. ""Tax changes will embolden those activists with a short-term focus to demand answers on the use of increased cash flows,"" he said, ""and companies who have not already developed and explained their plans will find it difficult to defend against these campaigns.""Despite Mr. Fink's insistence that companies benefit society, it's worth noting he's not playing down the importance of profits and, while it's a subtle point, he believes that having social purpose is inextricably linked to a company's ability to maintain its profits.On that score, Mr. Fink and Friedman aren't that far apart. ""It may well be in the long-run interest of a corporation that is a major employer in a small community to devote resources to providing amenities to that community or to improving its government,"" Friedman wrote in 1970, adding that this approach may make it easier to attract desirable employees along with ""other worthwhile effects.""But he also added a dollop of reality to the debate. Noting ""widespread aversion"" to things like capitalism, profits and the ""soulless corporation,"" he wrote that social responsibility is ""one way for a corporation to generate goodwill as a byproduct of expenditures that are entirely justified in its own self-interest.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/16/blackrocks-message-contribute-to-society-or-risk-losing-our-support.html

"        Struggling hedge fund manager Bill Ackman loses ADP board seat vote—CEO calls it 'ass-whipping'
			                 ",2017,11,07," Activist investor Bill Ackman lost his bid Tuesday for ADP board seats after a high-profile proxy fight with the giant payroll processor.Ackman's nominees received less than 20 percent of votes from shares outstanding and less than 25 percent of shares voted at the meeting. ADP announced its shareholders voted to re-elect all 10 of its directors, based on a preliminary vote count.""This was an ass-whipping,"" ADP President and CEO Carlos Rodriguez told Reuters after the announcement. Ackman, who heads the Pershing Square hedge fund, had nominated three directors, including himself. Two of the largest shareholders, Vanguard and State Street, voted for ADP's nominees, while BlackRock voted for Ackman. Ackman disputed the exact vote results, and said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street"" that he should have actually received 31 percent or 45 percent of the vote if votes were not withheld and were compared differently. ""I think that's a very strong vote of confidence from shareholders for our ideas,"" he said. Shares of ADP, which have a market value of $49 billion, recovered opening losses and were trading about 0.4 percent higher late Tuesday morning. ADP raised its quarterly dividend rate on Tuesday to 63 cents a share from 57 cents a share. The stock is up about 8 percent for the year. ""We would hope that this is a message not just to Bill Ackman but to all activists that ADP is I think on a strong foundation and on the right path,"" Rodriguez said on CNBC's ""Squawk on the Street.""""This country has a long tradition in economics and policy of respecting a vote,"" Rodriguez said, ""and I hope that Bill and everyone else would do that in this case and move on and let us move on with our business.""

P&G is the largest company in history to face a proxy fight.Rodriguez and Ackman have been engaged in a heated war of words over the last few months since the latter revealed his stake in August. Ackman has said ADP is ""very inefficient"" and suggested Rodriguez is not the right person to lead the company. Rodriguez has compared the activist investor's efforts to that of a ""spoiled brat"" who ""doesn't know what he's talking about.""  ""We didn't learn a lot of new things as a result of Bill's presentation and also his ongoing comments, but there's really no dispute about the company's path and what it needs to do,"" Rodriguez said. In response to a question, he added that he didn't think Ackman's sometimes fierce approach made a difference.Omega Advisors Chairman and CEO Leon Cooperman, who served on ADP's board for 20 years through 2012, told  Ackman his activist campaign was not ""intelligent."" ADP has ""quality management that has done a great job over many years for the shareholders,"" Cooperman said in August.Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management has a nearly 2 percent stake in ADP common shares, according to FactSet. Including derivatives, Ackman has an 8.3 percent stake.

He said Paychex competes in about 35 percent of ADP's businesses.Ackman unveiled an 8.3 percent stake in stock and options in ADP in August. The boardroom battle goes to a vote at the human resources service firm's annual shareholder meeting next week.In a statement to CNBC, the company said: ""ADP strongly rejects the false and reckless claims made by Pershing Square throughout the proxy contest and urges shareholders to vote in their own best interests on ADP's white proxy card."" Ackman said in the ""Squawk Box"" interview that ADP's shareholder base sees ""a big margin opportunity."" He said some of the investors he's spoken to believe the pressure he's applied is a ""positive.""If the company doesn't continue to innovate and become more efficient, it is going to lose ""significant market share,"" he said. He added that he has no desire to fire lots of employees, saying the HR solutions industry is growing. The biggest risk to ADP workers is from the company's failure to keep up with its competition, he said. Ackman said ADP has ""missed the boat on technology,"" describing the company's chief technology officer as not a ""technologist,"" but a business guy.In its statement, the company said: ""ADP is continuing to execute on a technology-driven transformation. ADP is now the largest Human Capital Management (HCM) provider in the cloud, with 83 percent of our clients on strategic cloud-based platforms.""Earlier, the company said it plans to file a complaint with the SEC against Ackman for releasing ""false and misleading"" information.In a letter to ADP on Wednesday morning, Ackman advocated that both sides ""get along for the benefit of all of ADP's stakeholders.""""Putting out a press release saying that you are reporting me to the SEC is a move designed to smear my reputation for a tactical advantage in a proxy contest.

"        P&G says shareholders reject Peltz's board bid by slim margin, activist says vote a dead heat
			                 ",2017,10,10," Procter & Gamble declared victory Tuesday over activist investor Nelson Peltz, saying initial figures show it won the biggest proxy battle in history. But the narrow win puts pressure on the owner of Bounty and Tide to move faster in its turnaround and regain the support of investors. ""The preliminary proxy results are ones I'm pleased with,"" said CEO David Taylor on CNBC. ""I know from talking to many investors, they support the strategy. Do they want to see us move faster — I'm sure — and we're moving faster.""P&G will file results with the Securities and Exchange Commission when the vote is finalized.Trian has already said it plans to challenge the proxy results. Peltz added in an interview with CNBC that regardless of the outcome he will continue to advocate for the company to follow his recommendations, which include streamlining its structure and small acquisitions of innovative brands.""I don't think they're serving their shareholders properly. I don't think they have a structure today that's right for that business,"" Peltz said. Peltz's fund Trian Partners revealed a roughly $3.5 billion stake in P&G in February and in June nominated him for a board seat.P&G shares closed Tuesday down less than 1 percent.  The consumer goods giant has for years struggled with market share as sales have slowed and it faces competition from more innovative or upstart brands. Under Taylor, who joined as CEO in 2015, the company simplified its corporate structure, streamlined its portfolio, poured more money into research and development and worked to improve operations.Since Taylor took the reins, P&G's stock has outpaced most U.S. consumer products companies, including Clorox and Colgate-Palmolive, though it underperformed against the With a market capitalization of $230 billion, P&G is the largest company to have fought a proxy fight and one of a few companies larger than $50 billion. Others include DuPont, which defeated Peltz in 2015 and Automatic Data Processing, which is ongoing. Although Peltz wasn't named a DuPont director, he did show an ability to influence the company's actions from outside the boardroom. DuPont ultimately combined with Dow Chemical. Activists often target smaller companies, because it is easier for them to buy shares that can impact the vote. Companies often settle rather fight proxy battles, because they can be costly and distracting.  At the crux of the battle was P&G's claim it had already launched initiatives to solve the problems that Peltz said he had identified. Peltz argued the efforts were insufficient.To support its cause, P&G enlisted the help of four banks: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Centerview and Lazard, as well as its former chief executive, A.G. Lafley.Peltz recruited P&G's former CFO, Clayton Daley, and won the support of all three proxy solicitors, Egan-Jones, Glass Lewis and ISS. The firms' opinions can sway but not always determine shareholders' votes.Combined, the two spent $60 million on the battle as they fought to woo P&G's major shareholders and large retail investor base.""If a company has a good management team, a good board and a good strategy, it's going to win a proxy fight with activist investors,"" said Scott Barshay, a partner and senior dealmaker at law firm Paul Weiss.Of P&G's top three shareholders, State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock sided with Peltz, while Vanguard backed P&G, according to sources familiar with the matter.Retail shareholders largely supported management, according to analysts' estimates based on the results. Brett Barakett, a P&G alumnus and investor, voted in favor of his former employer.""We think they are already far down the path of doing what is needed,"" said Barakett, the founder and CEO of Tremblant Capital. ""P&G has taken the correct strategic steps in this rapidly changing world.""To be sure, the vote's thin margin means there remains work for P&G to do in order to regain the support of a large percentage of its shareholders. Peltz said he will continue to be active from the sidelines, which should keep up the pressure. ""We believe the close vote should send a message to the board that shareholders are losing patience and no longer willing to settle for sub-par total shareholder returns and ongoing share losses,"" said Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Wells Fargo.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/10/procter-gamble-shareholders-vote-against-adding-nelson-peltz-to-board.html
"        A $235 billion fight over the future of P&G will be decided today
			                 ",2017,10,09," One board seat, one epic battle.In the the culmination of the largest-ever proxy fight, Procter & Gamble will find out Tuesday if shareholders want to give Nelson Peltz a seat on the board of the owner of Bounty and Tide.It's a fight that has cost millions and at times turned personal, pitting former colleagues against each other. P&G, which has a market capitalization of about $235 billion, has enlisted the help of four banks: Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Centerview and Lazard, as well as its former chief executive, A.G. Lafley, to support its cause. One estimate says it has spent $60 million to that end.The investor, meanwhile, has written a 94-page white paper and recruited P&G's former CFO, Clayton Daley. Both have reached out to the company's large retail shareholder base by email, paper mail, Twitter and Facebook. P&G, which is using a ""Vote Blue"" slogan for the campaign, created a website in P&G's trademarked color. Trian has created its own website, ""RevitalizePG.com,"" in blue a shade darker.The public battle has been brewing since February, when Trian revealed a roughly $3.5 billion stake in the company. And in July, Trian nominated Peltz to P&G's board of directors. All three proxy advisories — Egan-Jones, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services — are recommending putting Peltz on the board.The vote comes a day after General Electric put Trian co-founder Ed Garden on its board — amid pressure from the fund.Trian has criticized P&G for lagging in innovation and focusing too much on its core brands at the expense of launching and growing younger ones. It has critiqued the company's organizational structure, saying it is too complex and that it should consolidate from 10 operating units to three. P&G offers as innovation its 2012 launch of Tide Pods, a still growing $1.5 billion brand. It claims it has already evaluated Peltz's proposed operational structure and believes it will lead to more costs and bureaucracy than the current setup. The company also defends the import of large brands like its Dawn dish washing business, arguing these they still resonate with consumers because they work. ""Each side has valid points,"" Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets told CNBC. ""The question we are all going to ask tomorrow, whether Peltz gets a board seat or not, is what is Procter worth?""Modi and others have said that, if P&G wants to be worth more, it will have to innovate and grow its sales to offset the ground it has ceded to competitors that are stronger in digital and more on trend with consumers. The company that helped define brand marketing will also have to readjust to a new marketing age amid the rise of digital and social media.P&G has said it's working on it.The company sold its fragrance and color cosmetics business to Coty in 2016 so it could shift its focus away from trendier brands to its core strengths in products like detergent and toothpaste. After losing market share in China, it launched a more expensive diaper in the country to match demand. It has also simplified its organizational structure.The decision for voters, according to Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman: ""Does Peltz change the dialogue in a way that moves things forward?""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/pg-proxy-battle-nelson-peltz-procter-gamble-board-decision.html

"        Cramer Remix: My mea culpa on DexCom and where it’s headed
			                 ",2017,10,04," After the stock of DexCom plunged over 30 percent, CNBC's Jim Cramer had to investigate why shares of the top medical device maker got decimated.""DexCom's problem is pretty straightforward. A week ago, we learned that gigantic company Abbott Labs had received FDA approval for its new FreeStyle Libre Flash glucose monitoring system for people with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. And in many ways, this represents a major competitive threat to DexCom,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.DexCom is the leading maker of glucose monitoring systems, so analysts saw Abbott's new system, which is the first and only one to offer blood-sugar monitoring without the routine finger-prick, as a formidable challenge.But Cramer said that DexCom has come back from similar challenges before and should be able to stand up to Abbott's new product, perhaps even offering a version of its own eventually.""A year ago DexCom got slammed based on competitor concerns from another giant, Medtronic, and its so-called artificial pancreas — a glucose monitor combined with an insulin pump — but the stock was able to make a dramatic comeback, as DexCom's numbers continued to be excellent,"" Cramer said. ""Anyone who's owned this stock has been obliterated by the Abbott news, and that's terrible. Mea culpa again. But at these levels, I believe DexCom will be able to rebound, even if it might take some time.""In a red-hot stock market that can't seem to slow its winning streak, Cramer has been inundated with requests from viewers to lay out the market's negatives.""Now, I have endlessly told you how errant tweets, dysfunctional tax policy and 'little Rocket Man' can all create a hideous backdrop at any given moment,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""But those are all 'big think' issues, the kind of thing that drives me a little crazy, steams me, because it's total thumb-sucker journalism. It's central casting. It requires nothing that's even remotely like homework. It's by rote.""So, to give investors something to consider while they make decisions about their portfolios, Cramer decided to detail 10 overall negatives in the market.Workplace solutions giant ADP's proxy fight with activist investor Bill Ackman and his firm, Pershing Square, has not exactly been a private matter.In an increasingly heated, drawn-out exchange, Ackman and ADP CEO Carlos Rodriguez have been trading barbs as Ackman pushes for seats on the company's board, arguing that his candidates will help the company seize on an opportunity to improve its business model.""Our new question for ADP is why is it that ADP has lower revenue productivity than all of their competitors?"" Ackman asked in an exclusive interview with Cramer.In the Wednesday interview, Ackman said that ADP generates average revenue of $160,000 per employee, while its competitors average $224,000 per employee.""When you think about ADP, it has enormous scale versus the competitors. So, if anything, they should have more efficiency,"" Ackman told Cramer.For Cramer, insider trading is no joke.""The moment a company's management finds out that it possesses material non-public information, they must immediately close the window on insider selling. Otherwise, the chance is way too great that some executive will take advantage of that inside information and dump stock, which may have happened at Equifax,"" Cramer said.So as federal prosecutors reportedly look into why three Equifax executives sold almost $2 million worth of the company's shares just days after Equifax underwent a massive cybersecurity breach, Cramer called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate.Finally, Cramer examined Tyson Foods' almost superhero-like transformation to find out how the packaged food giant managed to forge its path to the top of a troubled industry.After a series of strong quarterly earnings results and sweeping initiatives employed by CEO Tom Hayes to improve the business, Tyson Foods' stock started to gain momentum.""[In] superhero terms, I'd say Tyson got its powers by mutating. The company changed in some big ways and it's quickly resulted in better numbers,"" Cramer said.The company also acquired AdvancePierre Foods Holdings, giving it a new ready-to-eat product line and exposure to convenience stores, which are outperforming the supermarket.Moreover, the stock's valuation is still fairly cheap, trading at only 13 times next year's earnings estimates, Cramer noted.""A year ago, Tyson looked like it was in real trouble. Now the company has taken the first steps toward transforming itself. It seems to be in great shape. Even though the stock has skyrocketed in recent months, I think it's got more room to run,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.In Cramer's lightning round, he shared his take on some callers' favorite stocks:Teva Pharmaceuticals: ""This bad news should've been in the stock. It wasn't. People had been waiting for it. That's the loss of Copaxone exclusivity. However, I will tell you this: if you want to buy, Allergan owns 10 percent of the company. I think they have to sell that stake. That would be the time to pull the trigger if, indeed, you did want to be in it, of which I'm not crazy about.""Seattle Genetics: ""They came through. Seattle Genetics, we met with them four years ago and I was really hopeful and it turned out they kind of spent some time in the wilderness and now they're in the land of Canaan. I want to own the stock.""Questions for Cramer? Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBCWant to take a deep dive into Cramer's world? Hit him up!

			                 ",2017,10,04," Workplace solutions giant ADP's proxy fight with activist investor Bill Ackman and his firm, Pershing Square, has not exactly been a private matter.In an increasingly heated, drawn-out exchange, Ackman and ADP CEO Carlos Rodriguez have been trading barbs as Ackman pushes for seats on the company's board, arguing that his candidates will help the company seize on an opportunity to improve its business model.""Our new question for ADP is why is it that ADP has lower revenue productivity than all of their competitors?"" Ackman asked. (The investor had been referring to ADP's ""labor productivity,"" a Pershing Square representative clarified to CNBC.)In the Wednesday exclusive interview with Jim Cramer on CNBC's ""Mad Money,"" Ackman said that ADP generates average revenue of $160,000 per employee, while its competitors average $224,000 per employee.""When you think about ADP, it has enormous scale versus the competitors. So, if anything, they should have more efficiency,"" Ackman told Cramer.Ackman mentioned Paychex CEO Marty Mucci's Tuesday appearance on ""Mad Money."" Twenty-five percent of ADP's business competes directly with Paychex, another payroll processing player that focuses mainly on assisting small- and medium-sized businesses.Mucci said his company was able to maintain its margins by keeping expenses ""out of the business"" and using the money to invest in technology. Ackman said he would like to see ADP mimic some of that strategy.But however sound the suggestions may seem, Ackman acknowledged that activist investing is no easy business. Much of it has to do with ""tactics,"" which may have been why Rodriguez, ADP's CEO, was so vocal about Ackman's strategy when he was in the public eye.""I think the advisors who advise companies on defending themselves from activists, they say, 'Look, you don't want to show that you're even open to what they have in mind, because if you do, then a lot of new people are going to come into the stock, a lot of more event-driven investors, and they're going to make it inevitable. You're going to lose a proxy contest,'"" Ackman said.The activist investor added that he remembered his early, private conversations with Rodriguez being ""all cordial, but when he went on TV, he ... behaved otherwise.""Conflict aside, Ackman told Cramer that ADP is something of a symbol when it comes to his central mission as an activist investor.""When the founder is around and in the boardroom, you've got a major shareholder there, companies don't lose their way. It's typically after the founder steps off the board, retires, passes away ... [that] the board becomes more professionalized. There's no one in the boardroom that owns a lot of stock in the company. And they get a little complacent,"" Ackman said. ""I think what activism is about is putting major shareholders in boards of directors so even though the founder is gone, there's someone there watching the store.""Ackman added that his firm's $2.3 billion stake in ADP puts him ""dollar-for-dollar"" with the company's other investors. The proxy battle will come to a head at ADP's annual shareholder meeting in November.""I think shareholders, really, all they care about is, is there an enormous opportunity to improve this company? Can adding a major shareholder to the board increase that probability? And I think the answer that we're hearing is yes,"" Ackman said.Questions for Cramer?

"        Former P&G CEO: 'I'm taking the gloves off' in battle against Trian
			                 ",2017,10,03," Former chairman and CEO of Procter & Gamble A.G. Lafley has come to the vocal defense of the consumer packaged goods giant as it gears up for the largest proxy vote in history.Lafley's former employer is embroiled in a battle with Nelson Peltz, whose fund Trian Partners has taken a $3.5 billion stake in P&G and  is seeking a board seat. The battle is set to come to a head on Oct. 10, when the company holds its annual meeting.In the letter, Lafley has some harsh words for both Peltz and Clayton Daley, who was Lafley's CFO for a time and was hired by Trian to run the fight.Lafley has not been in touch with Daley since he joined Peltz's campaign, he confirmed in an interview with CNBC. He spoke highly of Daley's tenure as CFO, though suggested Daley suffered memory lapses when critiquing P&G's sale of its beauty business and corporate structure. ""Mr. Peltz (and Mr. Daley) are clearly out for number one,"" Lafley wrote in a letter on Tuesday, ""They certainly don't represent me, a long-term shareholder.""The letter was titled, ""This is too important… I'm taking the gloves off.""Peltz delivered a 94-page white paper in September arguing that P&G's company structure is too complex, innovation too slow and financial planning too conservative. All three proxy solicitors — Egan-Jones, Glass Lewis and ISS — are recommending putting Peltz on the board of P&G.Lafley worked as CEO of P&G from 2000 to 2010 and again in 2013 to 2015. He oversaw some of the company's most sweeping changes, including the sale of its pet food brands to Mars for $2.9 billion, Duracell batteries unit to Berkshire Hathaway for $4.7 billion and beauty business to  Coty for roughly $11.4 billion.His second tenure at the company came after the then P&G CEO stepped down following a battle with activist Bill Ackman.Peltz started his campaign at a very different time than Ackman, said Lafley, noting Peltz is launching his fight as P&G's stock is at a high and the company has already slimmed its portfolio and improved its margins, in efforts largely overseen by Lafley himself. P&G's share price was roughly $62 when Ackman unveiled a stake in the company in 2012 and was roughly $88 a share when Peltz unveiled his position earlier this year. On Tuesday, P&G stock was trading just under $92. Pushing BackLafley pushed back on Peltz's boldest call — for P&G to simplify its matrix structure by reorganizing from 10 business units into three. He called the move a ""big step backwards,"" reiterating P&G's claim it will lead to more costs and more bureaucracy than its current set-up. The structure, said Lafley, allows the company agility to more strongly negotiate with its retailers and give proper attention to all its brands.He further defended the Gillette-owner against Peltz's critique the company has lost out on innovation, as upstarts like Dollar Shave Club or millenial-focused skincare lines have come into the fray. He noted brand innovation takes years of investment and took aim at Peltz's experience in the food industry  — which has had its own fair share of challenges with jumping ahead of trends. Peltz's Trian had taken positions at Mondelez and Kraft and Heinz before the latter two companies merged. ""[Peltz's] only experience is in the packaged food and beverage business,""  he said. ""In those categories, there has been virtually no real product innovation that has resulted in consumer preference.""Lafley alluded to accusations the company focuses on its legacy brands at the expense of launching new ones, saying the company has offered equal support to both large and small brands. ""Roughly half its current 65-brand portfolio is small, local brands,"" he offered. ""Most are leaders in their category; half were created by the company, half acquired; and includes a handful of new brands introduced in the past 10 to 15 years.""P&G launched ""Always Discreet"" in 2014, a new category for adults suffering incontinence, which has more than $200 million in sales and is growing 40 percent a year. The Tide pods business, which P&G launched in 2012, has $1.5 billion in sales.Lafley also took the opportunity to get personal.In countering criticism of P&G's fiscal conservatism, he noted that under Daley, P&G struggled to achieve an aggressive growth strategy that had planned for sales growth of 7 percent to 8 percent""This resulted in a CEO change,"" he said. ""Many shareholders wondered why there wasn't also a change in CFO.""Here is the full text of Lafley's letter:",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/03/former-pg-ceo-im-taking-the-gloves-off-in-battle-against-trian.html
"        Bill Ackman calls Chipotle stock 'extremely cheap' and says people in his office like the queso
			                 ",2017,09,20," Chipotle's largest shareholder, Bill Ackman, on Wednesday fought back at claims that the fast-casual restaurant chain's new queso wasn't good and that its sales would disappoint.Last week, Goldman Sachs said it would pass on Chipotle's stock after the negative response across social media that the company's new queso was ""gritty"" and ""disappointing."" The response could translate into weaker same-store sales for the quarter, Goldman analyst Karen Holthouse wrote.""I'm beginning to believe that Twitter is filled with a bunch of Chipotle short-sellers,"" the Pershing Square CEO said Wednesday.""People like it in the office. It [is not] filled with the chemicals that the normal queso [is]. It was quite an engineering exercise to get this thing done with natural ingredients. People like it. I'm going to try it,"" he said in an interview on ""Halftime Report.""Ackman, who is Chipotle's largest shareholder according to FactSet, said he can't disclose the company's store-by-store results of the queso rollout but he is ""hoping people are going to be pleasantly surprised.""The investor also said he is a ""big believer"" in Chipotle. He thinks the stock, which is down more than 17 percent this year, is ""extremely cheap.""""The stock went from $500 to $300 on a norovirus incident in one store. I think people should take a look at that one,"" he said.Although there are some ""weaknesses and some missing components to the management team"" the company has been filling out those elements, Ackman added.""They are very responsive and they want this to be an enormous success,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/bill-ackman-calls-chipotle-extremely-cheap-and-says-people-in-his-office-like-the-queso.html

"        Bill Ackman says ADP is 'overstating' its total return under current CEO
			                 ",2017,09,20," Bill Ackman fired back at Automatic Data Processing's management on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" Wednesday.The investor responded to a question on the company's presentation comparing ADP's stock performance under its CEO versus his hedge fund track record.""Those numbers are not correct and one of the things we're going to point out in a presentation we're going to release tomorrow is that the company overstates their total shareholder return under the CEO's track record,"" said the hedge fund manager, claiming ADP starts the calculation of the figure the day after the new CEO began, among other alleged mistakes.Ackman also cited how the return included the stock performance of CDK Global, which was spun off from the company in 2014.In a statement on Aug. 4, ADP compared its six-year stock performance under Rodriguez to Pershing Square's hedge-fund returns from 2012 to 2016.""Since Carlos Rodriguez became CEO nearly six years ago, ADP's total shareholder return of 202% is well in excess of the S&P 500 TSR of 128% - and is many multiples of Pershing's TSR of 29%,"" the company said.The hedge fund manager said ADP needed to make changes or it may face challenges like other big technology companies that didn't innovate.""I'm not saying ADP is IBM today, but it is at risk of becoming IBM if they don't take seriously the competitive threats they face and if they don't run their businesses as efficiently as they can,"" he said.His hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management has nominated three directors to ADP's board, including Ackman, for the Nov. 7 annual meeting.The firm said in a letter to shareholders Wednesday it has a $2.3 billion investment stake in ADP and is ""not seeking control of the company."" Last month ADP disclosed it had been approached by Ackman, and the two sides have engaged in a war of words since then.ADP CEO Carlos Rodriguez told CNBC on Aug. 10 that Bill Ackman reminds him of a ""spoiled brat"" who wants a schoolteacher to give him an extension.  Ackman revealed his ""transformation plan"" for ADP on Aug. 17 to more than double the company's stock price in an 167 slide presentation.ADP's profit ""margins are vastly below where they should be,"" Ackman said on a conference call, walking listeners through Pershing Square's analysis and research. ""ADP's historical success has made it a lethargic and inefficient sleeping giant,"" he wrote in the presentation. His hedge fund has stumbled in recent years with high-profile losing bets on Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Chipotle Mexican Grill.Pershing Square Holdings is underperforming the market this year. The fund is down 7.3 percent year to date through Sept. 12, according to its website. By contrast, the S&P 500 has an 11.5 percent return in the same time period.An ADP spokesperson sent the following statement in response to this story:""Pershing Square's claim that ADP has underperformed is not based on the facts. ADP has generated total shareholder returns in excess of 200% since Carlos Rodriguez became CEO nearly six years ago, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 and its peers. Over that same period, ADP has increased margins in core operations by 580 basis points, and continues to pursue an aggressive long-term strategy to further improve service and client satisfaction through technology transformation while driving revenue growth and margin expansion. ADP's Board is concerned that Pershing Square's extreme, swing-for-the-fences proposals and unqualified nominees would disrupt client services and damage relationships, putting ADP – and the value of shareholders' investments – at significant risk.""— CNBC's Liz Moyer contributed to this story.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/20/bill-ackman-says-adp-is-overstating-its-total-return-under-current-ceo.html

"        Billionaire hedge fund managers worried about North Korea risk, braced for a possible market drop
			                 ",2017,08,29," Hedge fund managers braced against a market fall this month because of rising geopolitical risk between the U.S. and North Korea.Tensions escalated again when North Korea launched a missile over Japan on Tuesday local time, driving U.S. stock index futures lower. In response, President Donald Trump later said in a statement, ""All options are on the table"" for North Korea.Earlier in August, he warned that any additional threats from North Korea ""will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before."" Hedge fund managers have been adjusting their portfolios. Bridgewater's Ray Dalio, manager of the world's largest hedge fund with $160 billion in assets, specifically cited the potential conflict between U.S. and North Korea leaders for his recommendation to buy safe haven assets.  ""Prospective risks are now rising and do not appear appropriately priced in,"" Dalio wrote in a LinkedIn blog post on Aug. 10.""Two confrontational, nationalistic, and militaristic leaders [are] playing chicken with each other, while the world is watching to see which one will be caught bluffing, or if there will be a hellacious war,"" he wrote.""We can also say that if the above things go badly, it would seem that gold (more than other safe haven assets like the dollar, yen, and treasuries) would benefit,"" he added. Dalio said investors should allocate 5 to 10 percent of their portfolios to gold.In similar fashion, Pershing Square Capital Management's Bill Ackman also revealed he prepared for the possibility of a stock market drop due to rising geopolitical risk. Ackman said during Pershing Square's second-quarter conference call on Aug. 16 that his firm took a ""small position"" in out-of-the-money call options on a volatility index.This hedge ""will protect against stock market risk,"" he said, citing a potential conflict on the Korean peninsula.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/29/hedge-funds-worried-about-north-korea-risk-braced-for-market-drop.html
"        Activist investor Bill Ackman made settlement offer to ADP
			                 ",2017,08,28," Billionaire investor William Ackman said he was not eager for a proxy contest with Automatic Data Processing and suggested that the board add his three nominees, a settlement proposal that was rejected, a new filing shows.  Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management owns 8.3 percent of the human resources software company, asked on Aug. 17 whether the ADP board would agree to expand by three and add his proposed directors, according to the Monday securities filing.  ADP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  One board member said ""they did not know but would think about the request,"" said the filing, which reflects Pershing Square's revised proxy solicitation materials. On Aug. 21 the company said the board unanimously declined to nominate any of Ackman's proposed directors.  ADP shares were up 1 cent at $104.60 in morning trading.  The filing was made to update shareholders about a telephone call Ackman had with members of ADP's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee. He plans to meet with the full board on Sept. 5.  The filing shows Ackman spoke with the board members only hours after making a 3-1/2 hour presentation that detailed the company's shortcomings.  One board member listened to a portion of the call but it was unclear whether the others heard any of it, the filing said. Certain members also had not seen the company's response to Ackman where management said the fund manager had presented ""nothing that had not previously been analyzed by the Board and management.""  In the roughly three weeks since Pershing Square disclosed its stake in ADP, the company has taken an unusual tack in dealing with one of the industry's most prominent activists.  In a preemptive move, the company issued a news release announcing Pershing Square's stake and saying that Ackman wanted control of the company and to replace the chief executive officer, and asked for a lot more time to do it all.  Traditionally, companies faced with an activist only issue a bland statement saying they welcome shareholders' input.  Ackman painted a different picture in filings and emails released publicly, saying he did not want control, was open to working with CEO Carlos Rodriguez and asked for only a short extension of the nominating deadline to negotiate more in private.  He said companies often benefited from having a large investor on its board.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/28/pershing-squares-bill-ackman-made-settlement-offer-to-adp-filing.html

"        Hedge fund manager Ackman threatened ADP with damaging media coverage, company says
			                 ",2017,08,24," Hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman threatened ADP with bad publicity if he were forced into a formal proxy contest for seats on the payroll processing giant's board, according to the company.ADP, which has been battling Ackman over his ""transformation plan"" to shake up the board and ""double"" its share price, detailed its behind-the-scenes negotiations with Ackman in a regulatory filing on Tuesday.Ackman wanted to avoid a proxy contest because it would have forced public disclosure and create the perception that the company and Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management were ""at war,"" the filing said. The activist fund manager has proposed a slate of three director nominees, including himself. That is something mentioned by Pershing Square's own proxy last week detailing the negotiations. Ackman wanted an extension to ""avoid taking the adversarial step of launching a proxy contest"" before meeting with the board, the hedge fund said in its filing. ADP's board announced its rejection of the nominees Monday. During a recent interview on CNBC, ADP CEO Carlos Rodriguez likened Ackman to a ""spoiled brat.""But ADP said Ackman told company that once he nominated directors, he would be committed to a proxy fight and would not settle. And, the ADP disclosure said, Ackman added that if he were engaged in a proxy fight, he would ""use his ability to generate media coverage to damage both Mr. Rodriguez and the company and that would be bad for the company's clients, employees and stockholders.""A spokesman for Pershing Square said declined to comment on Wednesday other than to point to its proxy statement, which didn't mention the talk about Ackman's ability to cause media coverage but did say Ackman told ADP it was in the company's interest to avoid the distraction of a board fight.Ackman offered ADP an olive branch of sorts on Thursday in a letter filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. ""As often happens in these types of situations, it appears that there have been misunderstandings over the past few weeks which unfortunately have clouded what should have been a productive relationship from the start,"" the letter said. ""I am sure that you would agree that it would serve all stakeholders if we can put these issues behind us and focus on what is in the long-term best interests of ADP.""Ackman is scheduled to meet ADP's board members on Sept. 5.From ADP's perspective, Ackman wanted an extension of time because he was going to be on vacation.According to ADP's proxy filing, the exchange between Rodriguez and Ackman went something like this: ""Mr. Rodriguez asked Mr. Ackman if he seriously expected a Fortune 500 company to change a published deadline so as not to interfere with his vacation, to which Mr. Ackman replied, 'I'm dead serious.'""Before the latest proxy, Pershing Square told CNBC that ADP's account, including its claim about Ackman's vacation, is ""totally false.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/ackman-media-coverage-adp-proxy-battle.html

"        Cramer Remix: You can never look at Foot Locker the same way again
			                 ",2017,08,21," When Foot Locker reported its much weaker-than-expected quarterly results that sent its stock down nearly 28 percent in a single day, Jim Cramer said he felt utterly ""blindsided.""""That's how I view this disastrous quarter from Foot Locker, results so stunning that I have to tell you, you can never, ever look at this company the same way again,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.But what was even worse than the headlines, which cited missed estimates and a 6 percent drop in same-store sales, was the management's commentary, Cramer said.Foot Locker CEO Richard Johnson said the team was working quickly to adjust to an rapidly changing retail landscape to make up for the shocking declines in Nike Jordans sales and Adidas Steve Smith Shoes, but Cramer worried that they couldn't work fast enough.The biggest shock to Cramer were the chain's stated ""double-digit declines in basketball"" shoes, a sign that could mean the retailer's problems go deeper than changing tastes.""That's why I say, even with the stock down from $47 to $31 in two days, it's still not a buy,"" he said. ""I just don't know what can turn it around. And you know what? I don't think they do either.""It became quite clear to Cramer on Monday that the stock market was trading on, well, nothing.""I've thought a lot about these periods and I've learned that there is such a thing as random movement periodically, and it always gets ascribed to something. The market's not always logical and the action doesn't always have to have a concrete cause,"" Cramer said. ""It might as well be ascribed ... to the eclipse.""For example, the Nasdaq extended its losing streak, led by technology stocks. FAANG, Cramer's acronym for the stocks of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google, now Alphabet, all opened lower.In due course, analysts scrambled to find explanations for the tech giants' declines, compiling obituaries about potential issues that could doom the stocks once and for all.""But this is what I mean about August,"" Cramer said. ""The fact is ... there's nothing really going on at Facebook, and nothing at Apple, Amazon, Netflix [or] Alphabet. They remain dominant in their industries, as dominant as they were when they reported their earnings.""After Automatic Data Processing announced on Monday that its board unanimously rejected Pershing Square's three board nominees, its President and CEO, Carlos Rodriguez, recalled a phone call with Pershing Square chief and billionaire activist investor Bill Ackman.""I had a conversation with Bill right before we, I guess, agreed to disagree that he was going to launch a proxy contest, and I asked him, 'Bill, I know you have a vacation, which is what's getting in the way and why you need to have an extension of this deadline, but when you get back from vacation, why can't we meet then?"" Rodriguez told Cramer on Monday.According to Rodriguez, Ackman then said that he was not yet ready with his presentation about the company, which eventually came out as a 167-slide clinic on ADP's alleged pitfalls.Rodriguez said that he and his management team saw Ackman's presentation no sooner than when it was released to the public, and that he would have appreciated the chance to meet with Ackman before its release to correct some of the report's ""wrong conclusions.""As shares of Macy's continue to slide on worries about the fate of brick-and-mortar retail, Jim Cramer wondered when the department store chain's stock would finally be too low to ignore.""That's kind of a loaded question because in reality, Macy's has been a value trap for a long time. Every time it starts to look like a bargain, the earnings estimates get cut again and the stock has another down leg,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. ""However, Macy's owns a lot of real estate underneath its stores, and if its stock keeps falling, sooner or later it will end up being cheaper than the company's sum of the parts valuation.""In other words, Macy's still has a lot of quality assets under its belt. It operates over 700 Macy's- and Bloomingdale's-branded stores, as well as 125 specialty shops that include outlets and Bluemercury locations.Until 2015, Macy's was seen as one of the top department store chains in the country, but the rise of online shopping made Wall Street wary of mall-based stores, Cramer said.Finally, Cramer spoke with Gary Wojtaszek, the president and CEO of data center real estate investment trust CyrusOne, one of the top players in outsourced, cloud-based storage solutions.""I think we're still in a first or second inning of a trend that's going to go on for another decade,"" Wojtaszek told Cramer on Monday. ""Everyone is starting to recognize more and more that it's much more effective to outsource all their data center needs, and all your FANG companies that you talk about all the time are also now starting to realize the opportunity to outsource to a company like us.""Despite being ""sold out"" of available space, Wojtaszek said his REIT has been growing steadily, boasting clients that include nine of the top 10 cloud companies in the world.""We have nine of the top ten cloud companies in the world. We're working hard to get the last one in the portfolio. And as the growth in cloud goes, so goes our company as well,"" the CEO said.In Cramer's lightning round, he flew through his take on some callers' favorite stocks:Autodesk: ""Yes, absolutely. I think there's nothing wrong other than some profit-taking in the Nasdaq. Remember, we felt that their biggest problem was piracy, and that's being solved.""Burlington Stores: ""I have to tell you, I think that Burlington's [earnings report is] going to be good because Ross [Stores'] was good. They're very similar models.""Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple, Facebook and Alphabet.Questions for Cramer?

			                 ",2017,08,21," ADP chief Carlos Rodriguez told CNBC that billionaire Bill Ackman refused to meet with company officials before the activist investor launched a proxy fight.""I had a conversation with Bill right before we, I guess, agreed to disagree that he was going to launch a proxy contest, and I asked him, 'Bill, I know you have a vacation, which is what's getting in the way and why you need to have an extension of this deadline, but when you get back from vacation, why can't we meet then?"" Rodriguez told ""Mad Money"" host Jim Cramer on Monday.Earlier Monday, ADP announced that its board unanimously rejected Pershing Square's three board nominees, including Ackman.According to Rodriguez, Ackman responded to the meeting request by saying he was not ready with his presentation. It eventually came out as a 167 slide show on ADP's alleged pitfalls.Rodriguez said he and his management team saw Ackman's presentation when it was released to the public, and that he would have appreciated the chance to meet with Ackman before its release to correct some of the report's ""wrong conclusions.""""I said, 'Well, when you're ready, we'll meet, whether it's late August, September,'"" Rodriguez continued about his call with Ackman. ""And he said, 'I'm afraid that's not going to work because that's not the way my business works. I have to have the leverage over the threat of launching a proxy contest in order to get you guys to agree to the things that I want to do with the company.'""In response to CNBC's request for comment, Pershing Square labeled the above correspondence as ""totally false.""The presentation called into question ADP's sales results and number of clients among other points that served Ackman's argument that the company is undervalued.""We kind of take offense to the implication that we are, I guess, playing with numbers or not disclosing information that we should be disclosing,"" Rodriguez said.For one, Rodriguez said the report used data from a 2009 presentation that included certain standalone clients — ones for whom the human capital management company only does one part of its services, like tax filing — which made ADP's number of clients look like it had decreased since then when it had not.Rodriguez also challenged the allegations that marked his company as unproductive, saying ADP had far outpaced the  index and Ackman's own fund in terms of performance.""[ADP's stock is] up 200 percent, S&P is somewhere around 80 to 90 percent over the same period,"" Rodriguez told Cramer. ""And, if I can add, because I think it's public information, Pershing Square is up ... 22 percent before fees and 7 percent after fees. Now, I'm not sure how it's possible to have that much in fees to have your return go down by that much, but that's what the published letter is from Pershing Square.""Rodriguez previously spoke out against the billionaire when Pershing Square, Ackman's hedge fund, took an 8 percent stake in ADP.The ADP CEO likened the hedge fund manager to a ""spoiled brat"" after Ackman told CNBC that he sought ""transformational change"" at the payroll processor that would include ""four or fewer"" board seats.On Monday, ADP said none of Pershing's board nominees would bring ""additive skills or experience to ADP's board.""Whether or not the proxy fight continues, Rodriguez said he hopes Ackman would convert his stock ownership into a true position rather than leveraging it on stock options.Rodriguez also said he and his colleagues didn't take the fight personally.""Despite what you might think, we're professionals and we don't take things personally,"" he told Cramer. ""So I think the manner is less important than the facts. And I think the facts speak for themselves. The performance that we have versus Pershing Square, the ideas which have been brought up which are not new to us and not new to the board of directors or to the management team. So I think it's a deeper issue than the manner and the form in which it was presented, but it was an odd way to approach a company.""Questions for Cramer?

"        Herbalife had talks to go private; steps up pressure on long-time nemesis Bill Ackman with tender offer
			                 ",2017,08,21," Herbalife said Monday it recently held talks to go private but the discussions ended on Wednesday without a deal.Herbalife's statement and its announcement of a stock buyback offer boosted its shares by 9 percent Monday morning.The potential buyer was not disclosed, but people with knowledge of the conversations said a ""major"" private-equity firm was involved and that due-diligence had been completed. Sources also said it was possible that the talks could resume.Such a transaction could be a significant blow for long-time nemesis Bill Ackman, who is short shares of the company, betting the stock will drop because he believes it is a pyramid scheme.Ackman's five-year crusade against Herbalife has largely gone the wrong way financially — and found him on the wrong end of one of Wall Street's most epic battles.Another billionaire, the financier, Carl Icahn, famously took the other side of Ackman's trade, with the two trading barbs live on CNBC in January 2013. At the time, Icahn threatened ""the mother of all short squeezes,"" in reference to what might happen to Ackman's short position if the company were to go private.Even though Herbalife said in its release Monday that the recent discussions ended without a deal to go private, Ackman may not come away unscathed.Herbalife also announced it was commencing a tender offer for up to $600 million of stock through a ""modified Dutch auction,"" a process that lets Herbalife buy back a large number of shares from existing shareholders at the lowest possible price. Herbalife set a range for the self-tender of $60 to $68.The company also said neither Icahn nor any members of the board of directors or the executive team would tender their shares.Still, the move to self-tender could add pressure on Ackman if the shares he borrowed to sell short are subsequently ""called back"" in the process. If that were to happen, Ackman could be forced to buy Herbalife stock in the open market at a potentially much higher price.In another twist with potentially damaging implications for Ackman, Herbalife said it would give participating shareholders a contingent value right, or ""CVR"" — an insurance policy of sorts should Herbalife announce a transaction to go private within the next two years. Such a move could give shareholders incentive to participate in the offering without the fear of missing out on a future deal. Sources told CNBC that Herbalife was concerned that the tender offer wouldn't be successful without the provision.Neither Ackman nor Icahn could be reached for comment.Herbalife said the offering would expire on Sept. 19.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/21/herbalife-had-talks-to-go-private-steps-up-pressure-on-long-time-nemesis-bill-ackman-with-tender-offer.html

ADP closed at $111.10 on Wednesday.The hedge-fund manager has become embroiled in a public battle with ADP management.Pershing Square recently took an 8 percent stake in ADP.

And the results indicate that a majority of these companies may find themselves with some empowered activists.Of the top 10 targets by market cap, as compiled by 13D Monitor, six declined on the day they reported earnings.Ericsson and Universal Health Services saw the biggest drops, with CenturyLink not far behind. The other three – Nestle, KKR and General Motors – ticked down only slightly.On the positive side were Caterpillar, Procter & Gamble and Honeywell. All three of those beat estimates for both their earnings and revenue and gained on the day they reported.Third Point's Daniel Loeb is angling for changes at Nestle and Honeywell. Trian's Nelson Peltz is taking on P&G and seeking a board seat.ADP reported earnings on the morning of July 27, and its shares were up slightly after that. But then, Bloomberg reported later in the day about Bill Ackman's stake and the stock surged from there.To be sure, not all of these situations have reached the point of a proxy fight.

"        ADP CEO unleashes on Ackman, calling hedge fund activist trying to remove him a 'spoiled brat'
			                 ",2017,08,10," The CEO of payroll processing company ADP on Thursday likened activist investor Bill Ackman's moves against his leadership to that of a ""spoiled brat"" who ""doesn't know what he's talking about."" Carlos Rodriguez of Automatic Data Processing made his comments on CNBC after Ackman's Pershing Square took an 8 percent stake in the payroll company and nominated three people, including Ackman, to the ADP board. Rodriguez said Ackman had requested an extension to the nomination deadline, citing vacation plans and the fact that he ""simply wasn't ready."" ""It kind of reminds me a little bit of a spoiled brat in school asking the teacher for an extension for their homework,"" Rodriguez said on ""Squawk on the Street"" in an interview with David Faber. Rodriguez said Ackman requested a 30- to 45-day extension on the nomination deadline, then revised it down to a week, but then added he might need more time after that. ADP revealed last Friday that Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management took an 8 percent stake in the company, mostly in derivatives. Rodriguez said Ackman called him to lay out ""a series of reasons why"" Rodriguez should not be CEO. ""I honestly can't make heads or tails of what's going on,"" Rodriguez said. ""What it feels like is I'm negotiating with someone about buying a used car. And this is not a used car. This is a company that has 58,000 employees, $50 billion market cap and a lot of shareholders that we have of responsibility toward."" Rodriguez said the company is in the process of scheduling a meeting with Ackman in ""early September."" The two men attended Harvard together, but despite suggestions they may be friends, Rodriguez said he met Ackman ""once, 31 years ago in college"" and is not on ""his holiday greeting card list as far as I can tell.""Last week, Omega Advisors Chairman and CEO Leon Cooperman, who served on ADP's board for two decades through 2012, told Ackman not to interfere with the payroll processor's operations. Rodriguez was named CEO in 2011.""This is a quality management that has done a great job over many years for the shareholders,"" Cooperman wrote in an email to Ackman. The email was obtained by CNBC's Scott Wapner. ""The idea that you can tell these guys how to run their business doesn't strike me as intelligent or appropriate."" Rodriguez said ADP was open to ideas Ackman had for improving the business, but noted that the activist's information so far seemed to come mostly from ""disgruntled, former employees."" ""I'm directly saying he doesn't know what he's talking about,"" Rodriguez told CNBC on Thursday. ""Frankly we haven't heard any ideas yet because he wasn't ready to share his ideas, but should he have come up with something or stumbled on some kind of idea that would enhance the value of ADP, of course we're going to listen to him."" Shares of ADP came off session lows to trade about 0.3 percent lower at midday Thursday after the interview.

"        Op-Ed: New Mondelez CEO's honeymoon could be cut short
			                 ",2017,08,02," Mondelez International's orderly succession planning is sweet inspiration for a situation that could soon turn salty. The $66 billion snack purveyor named Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld's replacement, reaching outside its ranks for frozen-food executive Dirk Van de Put. Others would do well to emulate the process, but the new boss may still walk into a merger fight.The Oreo maker isn't immediately showing Rosenfeld, 64, the door. She plans to step down as chief executive in November but will stay as chairman before Van de Put assumes that title, too, after the first quarter next year. Rosenfeld will help with the transition, guiding Van de Put through the various lines of its global business spanning products from Cadbury chocolates to Ritz crackers to Trident gum.Van de Put, who is 57 and currently running McCain Foods, will step into his new role at a turbulent time for consumer packaged-goods manufacturers. For one, people are more health-conscious and sugar in particular has become the latest no-no. Mondelez is focusing on emerging markets, which account for 40 percent of the top line, to counter the trend taking hold in developed countries. Still, the company said on Wednesday that net revenue for the second quarter fell 5 percent year-over-year to some $6 billion.More from Breakingviews: China's trophy case could become discount rack  Right now, Tesla is more than ever a carmaker  Sprint: Choose from the following M&A options The unsteadiness has made Mondelez a tempting target for cage-rattling investors like Bill Ackman and Nelson Peltz, though Rosenfeld invited the latter to join the company's board in 2014. Would-be acquirers are lurking, too. One is Kraft Heinz, backed by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital, which is eager to swallow its next target. Mondelez, which Rosenfeld spun out from the former Kraft Foods five years ago, could be in its sights since the failure of a $143 billion tilt at Unilever, which rebuffed Kraft Heinz's approach earlier this year.Mondelez may be on the expensive side for the time being. Its enterprise value tips the scales at roughly 16 times estimated EBITDA for this year, according to Thomson Reuters data, in line with Kraft Heinz. That may allow Van de Put a little time, but once he arrives at Mondelez, the honeymoon may be short-lived.Commentary by Jennifer Saba, a columnist at Breakingviews.

"        White House Communication Director Scaramucci on Trump: ‘He’s my client’
			                 ",2017,07,25," Here's the thing about the Mooch: When he sets a goal for himself, he somehow seems to find a way to accomplish it.The Mooch, of course, is Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House communications director for President Trump.For those of us who have covered Mr. Scaramucci's unlikely career on Wall Street over the years, his surprise appointment last Friday probably shouldn't have come as that much of a shock. Every time it appeared his career was on the ropes — after Goldman Sachs fired him, after the financial crisis left his fund-of-funds firm nearly out of business — he always found a way to come back.More from The New York Times:Anthony Scaramucci, Hedge Fund Showman, Finds Himself in LimboAnthony Scaramucci, New Communications Chief, Woos Trump on TVScaramucci Has a Showman's Knack for Self-Promotion Rivaling Trump'sAnd after the White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, ran a monthslong campaign to block his appointment to join the Trump administration as the director of the office of public liaison — and had seemingly succeeded — Mr. Scaramucci nevertheless found a way into the White House, reporting directly to the president.Which was completely true to form for the 53-year-old financier, who counts among his recent accomplishments getting CNN to apologize for a story it ran about him and to part ways with the three journalists whose names were on it.""I was left for dead on the street, and now I'm headed for Air Force One,"" Mr. Scaramucci said by phone on Monday, literally on his way toward Air Force One for a quick trip with the president to Beaver, W.Va.Mr. Scaramucci's detractors say he is a fast-talking, glad-handing, backslapping showboat — a self-promoter who is in love with himself and with access to power.Worse, they say, he was willing to sacrifice his principles to climb the Republican ladder and get close to those he bet would wind up with the most power: They tick off a list of Republican contenders he supported (Mitt Romney, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush) before ever sidling up to Mr. Trump. Indeed, Mr. Scaramucci once called the president ""a hack,"" a quote that has received its fair share of airtime over the past 72 hours.Back in 2015 when Mr. Scaramucci was still backing Mr. Walker, the governor of Wisconsin, he had some choice words for Mr. Trump on the Fox Business Network. ""The politicians don't want to go at Trump because he's got a big mouth and [they're] afraid he's going to light them up on Fox News and all these other places, but I'm not a politician,"" Mr. Scaramucci said on the air. ""You're an inherited money dude from Queens County — bring it, Donald. Bring it.""When I raised the issue with Mr. Scaramucci about whether he was sacrificing his principles, he said there was a time-honored tradition in political circles of changing your view of someone or something, and that the criticism he was getting for that was ""the most hypocritical thing in Washington."" He then offered up a list of politicians, including Ronald Reagan and Winston Churchill, who he said had changed their minds about particular stances and gone on to be considered legendary public servants.And, he said, context matters.At the time of his negative remarks about Mr. Trump, ""he was hitting the hedge funds,"" Mr. Scaramucci said, referring to Mr. Trump's attacks at the time on the industry as ""paper pushers.""""And I was hitting back,"" Mr. Scaramucci continued. ""I know how to fight.""And we know that Mr. Trump likes a fighter.Indeed, Mr. Scaramucci is about the closest thing to Wall Street's version of his new boss. He's a silver-tongued Trump. A consummate salesman, like his boss. He's an impresario, one of New York's most colorful characters, like his boss. He has written three books, similar to his boss's self-help books. (He has even written about remaking himself: One of his books is called ""Hopping Over the Rabbit Hole: How Entrepreneurs Turn Failure Into Success."")And Mr. Scaramucci believes that all — or at least, most — publicity is good publicity, as long as you spell his name right (which isn't that easy).Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Scaramucci is driven by a deep sense that he has something to prove.The comparison to Mr. Trump, he said, ""is a huge compliment."" But he was quick to wave it away. ""When someone says you're one in a million ..."" he began his next sentence, as if to suggest such a comparison can never be true. Then he pivoted to say that Mr. Trump is the anomaly. ""This a one-of-a-kind, incredibly unique individual.""As to whether Mr. Scaramucci, who has no political background or experience, can translate in Washington, he was fast to suggest that it would be a natural fit. ""Ironically, even though I'm a Wall Streeter, I gravitated towards the communications,"" he said. ""If I didn't have so much financial anxiety, I wouldn't have gone towards Wall Street.""Indeed, Mr. Scaramucci's improbable success may have stemmed, at least initially, from that anxiety. On paper, he's the American dream. He grew up in Port Washington, N.Y., where his father was a construction worker. He went to public school, then Tufts University and then Harvard Law School.He never practiced law, instead going directly to Goldman Sachs, where he was quickly fired and given an $11,000 severance. Never one to accept failure, he worked the phones and got himself rehired two months later in the firm's sales division.Mr. Scaramucci then co-founded Oscar Capital Management, a hedge fund, which he sold to Neuberger Berman, an investment management giant, in 2001. He then started SkyBridge Capital, a fund-of-funds, which, by his own estimate, almost didn't make it after the financial crisis.""That was a real bottom for me,"" he told me. ""We were almost out of business.""But he shrewdly bought Citigroup's fund-of-fund business in early 2010, just as it was trying to right its own ship. On top of that, he started the SALT conference in Las Vegas, which has become the world's most prominent event for the hedge fund industry (the name is short for Skybridge Alternatives).Mr. Scaramucci paid to bring some of the biggest speakers to the conference — George W. Bush and Bill Clinton among them — which in turn brought out the biggest names in the hedge fund industry, like Ken Griffin, Dan Loeb, Bill Ackman and Steven Cohen.He agreed to sell SkyBridge to HNA, the Chinese conglomerate, in January. (Again, his timing seemed to be sharp given the struggles the hedge fund industry has had.) The deal, which is being reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, still hasn't closed.Mr. Scaramucci bolstered his name by regularly making the rounds on CNBC and, later, Fox Business. He bought the legendary PBS show ""Wall Street Week with Louis Rukeyser"" and remade it on Fox. (I interviewed him a handful of times years ago on CNBC, where I am an anchor of ""Squawk Box."")He explained his relationship with Mr. Trump in terms of the banking business. ""It is a client service business,"" he said. ""And he's my client.""The question is, what does Mr. Scaramucci want next? His bet on Mr. Trump will either launch him into media superstardom and a possible political career, or leave him badly damaged. (He's already being criticized for being too sycophantic.)Will he be a moderating force within the White House, or perhaps an enabler? People who have seen Mr. Scaramucci and Mr. Trump interact say that he has gained the trust of Mr. Trump, such that in private, he can be blunt and honest, even when he disagrees with the president.But Mr. Scaramucci said, ""My views don't matter,"" adding, ""I've subordinated my views to the views of the president.""Still, he allowed, ""I'm not a shrinking violet.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/25/scaramucci-on-trump-hes-my-client.html

			                 ",2017,06,26," A plush penthouse in one of New York's most expensive buildings is headed to foreclosure, signaling new troubles for the high-end real-estate market.The 6,200-square-foot, full-floor unit at One57 is scheduled to go to foreclosure auction next month, according to Bloomberg.The apartment, known as Apartment 79, sold in 2014 for just under $51 million. The identity of the buyer is unknown because it was purchased through an anonymous limited liability corporation called One57 79 Inc. The LLC took out a loan from Luxembourg-based Banque Havilland in 2015. When the borrower defaulted, the bank forced a sale. When it opened in 2014, One57 was the shining symbol of a new class of luxury super-towers in Manhattan. Rising to over 1,000 feet, apartments were selling for nearly $7,000 a square foot, largely to overseas buyers. Billionaire hedge funder Bill Ackman and other partners bought the biggest penthouse for just about $90 million. Yet starting last year, an oversupply of luxury towers and a scarcity of overseas buyers have hurt the top of the market. New development sales fell 25 percent in the latest quarter and units at One57 are selling for discounts of more than 20 percent. The $51 million apartment is scheduled to head to auction on July 19. Another apartment that sold for $21 million at One57 went to foreclosure auction earlier this month, but there's no word yet on the result.(Correction: Bill Ackman purchased his apartment for just about $90 million.)

"        Herbalife cuts sales forecast, but boosts earnings guidance and exceeds key FTC mandate
			                 ",2017,06,04,"  lowered its sales outlook for the current quarter early Monday, as it gears up for tougher new Federal Trade Commission regulations that appeared to hurt business more than anticipated.Herbalife now expects revenue to be lower than prior estimates, with a key sales metric known as volume points expected to be 3 percent below its earlier view. Earnings per share were actually increased for the quarter and the full year.Herbalife expects adjusted profit of 95 cents to $1.15 per share in the second quarter ending June 30, compared to the 88 cents to $1.08 per share it expected earlier.The company said the transition to the new FTC rules along with softness in Mexico was to blame for the lowered numbers.""Whenever we introduce change in the marketplace there is typically a short-lived slowdown in sales followed by a return to growth,"" Herbalife spokesman Alan Hoffman said in an email. ""We believe this is a short-term episode and that the second part of 2017 will pick up.""The news comes only about a week after Herbalife had to begin adopting stricter new regulations mandated the FTC as part of its landmark settlement with the company back In August 2016. As part of that deal, Herbalife agreed to a $200 million fine, the biggest ever imposed by the commission, and stricter new rules related to how it accounts for sales of its nutritional products.Herbalife must now prove that at least 80 percent of its sales are made outside the company's distributor network, with a small portion of that number allowed for personal consumption by the nearly 300,000 distributors in the U.S. Those distributors must also provide receipts for their sales to show they have legitimate end customers. In addition, the company agreed to an outside monitor for seven years to make sure it complies with the new rules.Though the company said preparing distributors for the new regulations likely impacted sales, there was a silver lining in the disappointment. Herbalife said it easily exceeded the new FTC threshold, showing that 90 percent of sales since May 1 have met the new guidelines.""We knew we would be able to meet the threshold test of 80 percent because we knew we had real customers,"" Hoffman said.The company said it could also show that it has 400,000 so-called ""preferred"" members in the U.S. who buy products at a discount and aren't pursuing the business opportunity in any way.Though the cut in guidance could give the activist investor William A. Ackman renewed ammunition in his claim that Herbalife's business will suffer under the weight of the FTC's new rules, the strength of documented sales from outside the company's distributor base runs counter to his claims that Herbalife has no ""real"" customers.""These figures should put an end to any questions regarding demand for our nutritional products and the strength of our go-to-market business model,"" said Richard P. Goudis, Herbalife's new CEO.Ackman has been short Herbalife shares since 2012, but has lost money on the investment as the stock has traded much higher than he expected. Part of that has to do with rival billionaire Carl C. Icahn, who famously took the other side of Ackman's Herbalife trade and remains one of the company's most powerful financial supporters. Icahn and Ackman famously brawled on live television in January 2013 and are still at odds over the company's future. Icahn has bought more shares in recent months to increase his stake to nearly 25 percent.When reached by phone on Sunday night and asked to respond to the coming announcement, Icahn said he wasn't alarmed by the lowered sales outlook for the quarter but rather emboldened by the strength of the documented sales and the fact that earnings guidance for the June period and the full-year were taken higher.""I think this validates the fact that people use the product who are not distributors and it makes any claim against that absurd,"" said Icahn. ""But more importantly I think it's ironic, but factual, that as a result of the propaganda against the company that it now has a much better idea of who their customers are and it opens the door for Herbalife to greatly benefit from e-commerce. Many people in my office use and truly like the products. To digress, it's sort of funny that at times throughout the last four years I felt almost compelled to add to my position when the stock was depressed because of inaccurate rumors out there that I was selling. Obviously, the stock I purchased is much higher today. I haven't sold a single share."" approached a record high just last week.—Reuters contributed to this report.CORRECTION: This article has been updated to correct the spelling of Richard P.

			                 ",2017,05,10," Hedge fund Pershing Square has an unnamed investment position that is up big so far this year, founder Bill Ackman said on an investor call Wednesday.""Our undisclosed position [is] up slightly more than double digits,"" he said on the firm's quarterly call. But Ackman said year-to-date performance for Pershing ranged from 1.9 percent to 3.6 percent, depending on the specific fund. The S&P 500 is up more than 7 percent this year at record highs. Pershing managed more than $10.9 billion at the end of 2016.Ackman told investors in January he had put 10 percent of the fund's capital in two new positions, but declined to reveal what they were.""We made two new investments over the past four months. One we continue to retain,"" Ackman said on Wednesday's call. ""We believe it's an attractive investment and if were priced at a lower price we would buy more.""The hedge fund manager said the name he still holds is up roughly 30 percent. That investment comprises 5 percent of capital, he said. ""The only disappointment on our part is that we did not get enough before the stock started to run."" And here's the kicker. It sounds like he's not planning on letting it get out what this position is until Pershing has already sold. ""We still like it at the current share price, [but] not enough to add,"" Ackman said. ""Once we exit, you can expect some type of update from us on that investment.""Ackman said his firm already exited the other investment due to ""business developments at the company that caused us to question our decision to continue to hold the investment."" Depending on changes in the business, ""we may enter again,"" he said. On Monday, Ackman reiterated a recommendation on shares of Howard Hughes at the Sohn Investment Conference, presented by CNBC. A short position in Herbalife and declines in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac contributed to ""big losses"" for Pershing Square, Ackman said. Fannie and Freddie both lost just more than 30 percent, while Herbalife is up 51 percent.On the call, Ackman maintained his negative view on Herbalife and said he expects resolution on restructuring of Fannie and Freddie to come in the next 18 months, ""well within our time frame.""— With reporting by CNBC's Amanda Lasky.

"        This week: The impact of the French election on markets; plus, some all-star stock picks
			                 ",2017,05,07," We've been watching earnings and big U.S. economic indicators like Friday's jobs report as of late. However, this week kicks off with big market-moving news from overseas: The French election.France's election was a showdown between mainstream candidate Emmanuel Macron and upstart populist Marine Le Pen.For a while, it looked like Le Pen — occasionally referred to as France's Donald Trump — might pull off an earth-shattering upset that would lead to all kinds of ramifications. Not least among the possibilities was that France might follow the UK's lead in leaving the European Union, an event that could snowball across the continent.Instead, Macron cruised to victory in the runoff election Sunday. Should that remain the case, it's widely expected to trigger an even bigger rally in global stocks. However, that doesn't necessarily mean U.S. stocks will get a boost. Some big names that do a lot of business in Europe such as Visa and McDonald's are expected to see a boost, but as of Sunday night, U.S. stock-market futures, which are used as a gauge of which way stocks will go when trading opens at 9:30am ET, were slightly negative.The week is pretty sparse as far as market-moving economic reports go. But there is one coming up on Friday that will get some attention.That's when the government will report the latest inflation numbers as expressed through the Consumer Price Index. The CPI puts together a list of goods and services and tallies up the price, then expresses the measure in percent change in both monthly and annual terms.Economists expect the report to show that prices rose 2.3 percent on the year and 0.3 percent for April.Why it matters: The Fed is almost certain to raise its benchmark interest rate another quarter-point in June, but it will be looking closely at inflation numbers before doing so. The U.S. central bank wants to see inflation hover around the 2 percent mark. If the CPI report meets expectations, it makes it even more likely the Fed will hike.And, when the Fed raises rates, that means rates on everything from your credit card to your mortgage will start going up as well — particularly if you have variable interest rate.Friday also brings a report on retail sales, which have been really weak. Economists are expecting a rebound for April, with the monthly gain projected to be 0.6 percent, according to FactSet.One of the most popular sayings on Wall Street is ""Sell in May and go away."" May through October tends to be a volatile period so that's how this catch-phrase came to be. There's actually been some historical wisdom to the saying.Since the end of World War II, the  stock-market index has gained an average of 6.7 percent from November to April, but then has moved up just 1.6 percent from May to October, according to Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at CFRA.Two things to keep in mind, though, before calling your advisor: 1) This year is anything but typical. With President Donald Trump pushing an aggressive pro-growth agenda, the past may not be prologue for the current setup; 2) Stovall also has found that shifting allocations from cyclical stocks like energy and materials into defensive sectors like staples and utilities has been better than selling in May and going away.""History says investors would be better off rotating then retreating,"" Stovall says.Of course, there's a third point: The market is getting rich, so this could be a good time for a pause or perhaps mild pullback. Now, that doesn't mean head for the hills. If you want to trade like the pros, be ready to buy on the dip. When stocks fall it can be scary but if you have the stomach for it, you can find some great bargains — and make some money.Investor conference season has been in full bloom for the past several weeks, and this week features one of the biggies.The Sohn Investment Conference is set for Monday in New York. And, even if you're not attending, pay attention to the headlines. You'll see a lot of stock picks coming from some of the biggest names in investing. Some of the headline-makers include Bill Ackman, David Einhorn, Jeffrey Gundlach and Larry Robbins.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/07/this-week-in-business-the-french-election-all-star-stock-picks-and-more.html
"        Money managers take off the gloves in dealing with companies
			                 ",2017,04,25," As a steward of pension funds and retirement accounts, Neuberger Berman has traditionally employed a staid strategy familiar among big Wall Street money managers: Buy and hold stocks, sit back, and hope for the best.But recently, the firm eschewed its nearly 80-year-old tactic of playing nice. Instead it turned to the bare-knuckled world of activist investors made famous by the likes of Carl C. Icahn and William A. Ackman.Last year, as Neuberger Berman's roughly $200 million investment in Whole Foods Market languished, the firm quietly approached some hedge funds and urged them to agitate for change at the high-end grocer.Two weeks ago, Jana Partners took up the fight.More from The New York Times:  Bring Back Glass-Steagall? Goldman Sachs Would Love ThatHow Trump's Pick for Top Antitrust Cop May Shape CompetitionRobin Hood, Favorite Charity on Wall Street, Gets New LeaderJana — an $8.5 billion hedge fund behind some of the most high-profile recent corporate shake-ups — announced it was the second-largest shareholder in Whole Foods and blasted everything from the financial nuts and bolts, to the scheduling of employees and even the behavior of top executives. In a flash, Whole Foods' shares jumped 10 percent, adding millions of dollars to the value of Neuberger Berman's stake.Neuberger Berman's behind-the-scenes campaign to shake up Whole Foods is the latest example of a dynamic that is upending relations between public companies and the big investors that own their stock.For decades, Neuberger Berman — which invests some $267 billion for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and individuals — and peers like T. Rowe Price and BlackRock were reluctant to rock the boat at the companies they invested in. Agitating for change was left to the activist hedge fund managers like Mr. Icahn and Mr. Ackman, rabble-rousers with a reputation for shaking up companies, raising their stock prices and making big profits.But these two worlds are increasingly colliding in showdowns at companies including Dell, Microsoft and now Whole Foods, a reflection of the shifting balance of power on Wall Street.Traditional money managers in search of market-beating returns are demanding a seat at the table, turning to activists for help and even employing some hedge fund tricks of their own. And activists, once the black sheep of the investment world, are now accepted as regular, if meddlesome, investors.Do companies ""really listen to the feedback they get from their mainstream investors?"" said Michelle Edkins, global head of corporate governance at BlackRock. ""I think they are certainly making an effort to listen more.""But activists, she added, ""can act as an important 'check and balance' on management that has lost its way.""Before Neuberger Berman approached the activists, it talked to Whole Foods representatives and made its case for change. While the company undertook some reforms — for one, scrapping its dual-chief-executive structure in November — the conversations yielded little effect on the company's dwindling share price.So Neuberger Berman executives prepared an inch-thick presentation, the kind of document usually produced by activists. It took broad aim at Whole Foods, criticizing everything from its cozy board and wilting produce to its pricey real estate in well-heeled neighborhoods like Columbus Circle, where Whole Foods has a store in the Time Warner Center — one of the most expensive retail spaces in New York City. With that in hand, they approached several hedge funds, including Starboard Value and Elliott Management.Before long, Jana was amassing shares of Whole Foods. On April 10, as it unveiled its stake in the company, it ticked off a list of complaints that echoed Neuberger Berman's concerns: The brand was suffering, customer service was lagging and the company needed fresh blood on the board.Jana declined to comment.Neuberger Berman declined to comment about its interactions with hedge funds regarding Whole Foods, but said the firm was willing to take a more active role in certain situations. ""We have engaged with the company quite aggressively over the course of the last period of time,"" said Joseph Amato, president and chief investment officer of Neuberger Berman, referring to Whole Foods.Relations between institutional investors and activists have evolved in recent years, and it is not unheard-of for big investors to support activists who have set their sights on a high-profile company. In 2013, T. Rowe Price teamed up with Mr. Icahn to oppose a leveraged buyout of Dell.Southeastern Asset Management, another institutional investor, worked with Mr. Icahn on another offer to buy Dell, and also supported an effort by Barington Capital Group, a hedge fund, to shake up the retailer Dillard's. And ValueAct Capital, a hedge fund that focuses on technology investments, took a stake in Microsoft knowing it had the support of other big shareholders, ultimately winning a seat on the board.Neuberger Berman has taken a more confrontational approach before. Last year it campaigned for change at another company in which it had invested, the technology company Ultratech. It secured two board seats, but the process, Mr. Amato said, was ""in all honesty expensive and time-consuming.""In the case of Whole Foods, Neuberger Berman lobbied for the activists to do the messy work of battling the company in public.At the same time, activists, and Jana in particular, have grown more comfortable working with institutional investors. Before Jana went public in 2012 with its fight against Agrium, the Canadian fertilizer company, it met with other shareholders and sought their support. And the year before, when Jana was pressuring the publisher McGraw-Hill to spin off part of its business, it did so with the support of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.But it is less common for an institutional investor to share its work on a specific target with activists in the way Neuberger Berman did with Whole Foods. Mr. Ackman has described receiving occasional calls from institutional investors hoping to pique his interest in a company. There is even a term for the interplay: ""R.F.A.s"" or ""requests for activism.""For many large shareholders, the 2008 financial crisis was the turning point that led to greater collaboration with activists. Investors watched as the value of their stock portfolios plummeted.They began to ask whether a company's board and its executives were doing enough to fix their business. Sometimes talking to an executive was not enough to prompt change, and the prospect of working with an activist did not seem so outlandish.At the same time, activists, who at times could be brash, have softened their images. Third Point's Daniel S. Loeb — once famous for the verbal invective that he lobbed at chief executives — has opted more recently for the quiet approach of complimenting executives but emphasizing ""undervalued"" aspects of their businesses. In a letter to investors two years ago he sought to dispel the notion that activists were ""hit and run"" investors.""It might surprise people to hear that we completely agree that the sort of activism they describe is abominable,"" he wrote.That's not to say the activists are always right. In 2015, Mr. Ackman made a big bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International. But the company was hit by regulatory and political scrutiny in the past year over its drug pricing and its relationship to a mail-order pharmacy, and its stock took a beating. Last month, Mr. Ackman sold his firm's entire stake in Valeant, resulting in a $4 billion loss, and apologized for what he called a ""huge mistake.""In the case of Whole Foods, Jana has focused on a broad range of issues with the business — which has gained the name ""Whole Paycheck"" for its expensive products. It pointed to failures in how Whole Foods handled its brand development, and to what it said were customer service deficiencies and a poor strategy for distribution.Once the vanguard of the natural and organic food movement, Whole Foods now faces competition from big-name grocers like Safeway and Costco that have started to offer similar organic products, at lower prices.As its share price slid last year, Whole Foods cut its prices, offered promotions and started a loyalty program. After Jana's announcement, the company said it was ""committed to driving value for all Whole Foods Market shareholders and will continue to act to achieve this important objective.""But analysts have speculated the company could be a takeover target, which would result in a big payday for Jana, Neuberger Berman and other investors. A flurry of reports of takeover interest — the supermarket chain Albertsons and Amazon, the e-commerce giant, are reported to have explored bids — has helped to lift the share price.Charles Kantor, who oversees Neuberger Berman's investment in Whole Foods, said that the company had ""a phenomenal brand and had executed the difficult things,"" but that ""they haven't done well with the basic Retail 101.""Mr. Kantor said it was normal for his group to speak with other investors. But, he added, ""We've never made an investment predicated on an activist showing up.""—Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/25/money-managers-take-off-the-gloves-in-dealing-with-companies.html

			                 ",2017,03,30,"Vanity Fair's William Cohan, ""Why Wall Street Matters"" author, weighs in on Pershing Square Bill Ackman's Valeant apology to investors.",https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/03/30/this-is-a-whopper-of-a-loss-for-bill-ackman-vanity-fairs-cohan.html
"        Hedge fund giant Ackman tells investors he's learned from his Valeant debacle
			                 ",2017,03,29," Hedge fund magnate Bill Ackman is coming off the worst two-year stretch of his career, and he wants his clients to know he's learned his lesson.Owing largely to a disastrous investment in Valeant, a pharmaceutical company that came under fire for its pricing practices and other issues, Ackman's Pershing Square Holdings saw returns for its $11.1 billion main fund tumble 13.5 percent net of fees in 2016, according to a report the company released late Tuesday.That's coming off a 2015 loss of 20.5 percent for a fund that historically has done very well against market benchmarks such as the . The fund has more than tripled the index's return since 2004, according to Pershing records.The annual report gave Ackman the opportunity to offer a mea culpa for the loss and to explain to investors what he learned from the experience, with special focus on the Valeant investment.""My approach to mistakes is that I personally assume 100 percent of the responsibility on behalf of the firm while sharing the credit for our success,"" Ackman said.""While I and the rest of the Pershing Square team have suffered significant losses from this failed investment as we are collectively the largest investors in the funds, it is much more painful to lose our shareholders' money, and for this I deeply and profoundly apologize,"" he added.Pershing exited its Valeant position earlier this month at a price that he said in the letter could ""end up looking cheap."" He believes the company has made some important changes but still has ""a lot of work"" left. Moreover, he said, future gains are likely to be incremental and unlikely to justify the firm's continued involvement.His listed four takeaways as lessons from the investment: That managerial competence in deploying capital doesn't translate to value-added for a business; that ""changes in regulations, politics or other extrinsic factors"" can't be accounted for and can dent value; that even a strong management team can make mistakes; and that a big price decline in a stock ""can destroy substantial amounts of intrinsic value"" including ""morale, retention and recruitment.""Valeant — down 19.2 percent in 2016 — was the most public setback for Ackman, but it was far from his only loss. In fact, winners and losers were split evenly, with the Valeant loss tilting the scale negative in terms of returns for the fund.""We are extremely focused and working hard to continue to repair the damage done from our investment in Valeant by diligently overseeing our existing portfolio companies and identifying new opportunities,"" Ackman said.Pershing did have two hugely successful exits during the year: Canadian Pacific, after seeing a 318.9 percent return, and Zoetis, with a 57.9 percent gain in just two years.There was another bright side for investors in the downturn — they got a break on fees.While the industry has long relied on the 2-and-20 formula — 2 percent of assets as a management fee plus 20 percent on performance — more and more firms are breaking away from that model. The current industry average now is 1.6 percent and 17.7 percent respectively, according to Hedge Fund Research.Pershing clients typically pay 1.5 percent and 16 percent, but a change last year sent fees even lower. Clients now will pay lower fees when the gross fund return is less than 16.5 percent, and more when that level is exceeded. The letter did not specify how high or low those fees would go.However, clients won't pay any performance fees until Pershing's net asset value climbs above $26.37 a share — the ""high-water mark"" for the fund the last time a performance fee was charged. To get there, the fund would have to climb nearly 45 percent from the net asset value of $18.25 at the end of February.The fund has not had a single-year gain that high since its inception in 2004, according to firm records, though it did top 40 percent in 2004 and 2009.Ackman said he's dedicated to getting the fund back on track.""With a strong commitment to the core principles that have generated the vast majority of our returns since inception and the best and most experienced team that we have had since the formation of the firm more than 13 years ago, we are well positioned for a strong recovery,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/29/bill-ackman-tells-investors-he-has-learned-from-his-valeant-mistake.html
"        US Senate panel presses SEC nominee Clayton on conflicts
			                 ",2017,03,23," Jay Clayton, the Wall Street attorney tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, on Thursday defended himself against charges from Democrats that he had multiple conflicts of interest that would cause him to miss too many SEC votes.Clayton, a partner at elite commercial law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, is expected to win confirmation easily, but Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee raised concerns about his professional ties to Wall Street, particularly with Goldman Sachs, a bank he represented during the financial crisis and that employs his wife, Gretchen.Clayton, who is not registered with any political party, also told the committee the Dodd-Frank financial reform law should be reviewed, adding that whether it has been effective is on the minds of Trump administration officials.The senior Democrat on the committee, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, said he was concerned Clayton's Wall Street relationships pose a ""host of conflicts,"" and may have to recuse himself too often from SEC votes.The SEC enforces securities laws and regulates U.S. stock, options and bond markets.Clayton's client list has included Barclays, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Canada, as well as Bill Ackman's hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management. He also represented William Erbey, former executive chairman of mortgage servicer Ocwen Financial Corp, who was forced to resign as part of a settlement stemming from an investigation into improper foreclosures.""You've spent your career protecting some of the biggest names on Wall Street, and those relationships pose a host of conflicts for this position,"" Brown said. ""I'm concerned that you may need to recuse yourself too often at a time when we need a strong, independent SEC chair on the front line of enforcement, not watching from the sideline.""Clayton's potential recusals could be significant because the commission currently only has two sitting members: Democrat Kara Stein and Republican Michael Piwowar.Without two additional nominees to round out the commission, every Clayton recusal could set up a situation where the two remaining commissioners would not be able to agree on passing regulatory or enforcement actions.Clayton pledged to be tough on fraudsters in his opening statement to the committee in his testimony.""Bad actors undermine the hard-earned confidence that is essential to the efficient operation of our capital markets,"" he said to the panel.Clayton will recuse himself from matters in which he has a financial interest, according to his disclosures with the Office of Government Ethics. He also told senators he was in discussions with that office and the SEC's ethics office to identify potential clients.But Clayton said his long history as a transactions lawyer will be a ""strength"" for the chair role.His wife is expected to resign her post at Goldman if he is confirmed by the full Senate.The nominee said he would not show favoritism to Trump or anyone else in enforcing SEC rules. Trump, a real estate magnate in his private life, has had issues come before the commission and interacted with a previous chair, Harvey Pitt, Brown said.Committee Republicans led by Chairman Mike Crapo of Idaho pressed on how to engender capital formation, a goal the Trump administration has embraced.Cindy Fornelli, executive director at the Center for Audit Quality, a nonprofit whose board includes corporate chiefs and audit firms, said she hoped Clayton would continue a project started by the previous chair, Mary Jo White, to streamline corporate disclosures.""I would be surprised if he didn't,"" she told Reuters in an interview before the hearing. ""He is a transactional lawyer and knows very well the complexities and arcane nature of our disclosure regime.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/23/us-senate-panel-to-weigh-confirmation-for-sec-nominee-clayton.html

"        Ackman's exit sends Valeant shares to more than 7-year low
			                 ",2017,03,14," Shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals dropped Tuesday after news surfaced late Monday that billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman sold his remaining stock in the company. Valeant's U.S.-traded shares closed the day down more than 10 percent, at less than $11 a share and a level not seen since May 2009 during the financial crisis.  Sources told CNBC on Monday that Ackman sold his 27.2 million shares in Valeant at around $11 each. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management had purchased the stock at an average cost of $196 a share in 2015, according to the hedge fund's 2016 letter.Ackman then told CNBC that he sold his stake because it wouldn't ""move the needle for Pershing Square, even if the stock doubled from here.""The activist investor's decision to sell his stake in Valeant was a stark reversal, and it sparked jitters among investors.Ackman doubled his bets on Valeant in the past — refusing to get out while other investors ran for the hills — on the grounds that the pharmaceutical company's management could turn the business around.However, the stock has dropped 60 percent in the last half a year after the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission, three state agencies and two congressional committees launched investigations on reported price gouging in 2015.Ackman should have ""set limits"" as he's touted the stock over the past few years, David Maris, a Wells Fargo senior analyst, said Tuesday on CNBC's ""Fast Money Halftime Report."" ""There has to be restraint, but there also has to be responsibility,"" said Maris, a bear on Valeant since he initiated coverage in February 2016. Now that someone who was ""so close"" to the company — Ackman was — is walking away, that's probably not a good sign, Maris said. Shares of Valeant have been on a sharp decline since hitting an all-time high of $263.81 a share in August 2015.

Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management purchased Valeant at an average cost of $196 a share in 2015, according to the hedge fund's 2016 letter.Pershing Square said in a statement that Ackman would remain on the board, but would not stand for re-election.The firm said, ""At its current market value, the Valeant position represented 1.5% to 3% of the various Pershing Square funds; however, the investment required a disproportionately large amount of time and resources.""Ackman told CNBC that he sold his stake because it wouldn't ""move the needle for Pershing Square, even if the stock doubled from here."" Valeant shares ended Monday's session around $12.11, a fraction of their all-time high of $263.81, a record set in August 2015.While Ackman believed in the company, the hedge fund manager told CNBC that he underestimated the damage and didn't realize how bad the situation was until he joined the board. He said that he probably should have sold his position earlier.Pershing Square said Valeant CEO Joe Papa and his team ""have done an excellent job refocusing and setting a new course for the company"" and wished the company well.Ackman previously told CNBC that the cratering of Valeant's stock price led to the ""worst period of performance"" in his investment career. Last year, Ackman said he ""of course"" regrets his initial investment in the embattled pharmaceutical company. He said he thought seriously about selling his stake, but decided he could ""fix it.""The Canadian drugmaker first came under fire for allegations of using a network of specialty pharmacies to sustain sales of their high-priced drugs and prevent patients and insurers from switching to cheaper generic drugs.

"        Buffett's not the only one mad at hedge funds, with more investors likely to yank cash this year
			                 ",2017,02,26," Hedge fund managers had a rough year in 2016, and pretty much none of their customers were happy about it.At a time when legendary investor Warren Buffett has almost nothing nice to say about big money managers, investors say they plan on allocating less money than they did in 2016. During that year, hedge funds surpassed $3 trillion in total assets but also saw some $110 billion walk out the door as investors grew unhappy with sub par returns.In all, just 3 percent said returns for the year topped expectations, according to a survey of managers and investors conducted by industry tracker Preqin. Only 31 percent said returns met expectations, while 66 percent said returns fell short.Of course, hedge fund investors are a fickle crowd. Back in 2013, when the industry rode a red-hot stock market to a 9 percent gain, a mere 21 percent said returns beat their hopes.Yet coming on the heels of a big year for outflows, another weak performance could siphon even more cash out. Meanwhile, Buffett took aim at hedge funds in his annual letter released on Saturday, excoriating them for charging big money for advice that has largely under-performed low-cost index funds.""Preqin's interviews with investors at the end of 2016 indicate that the fundraising challenges of the past year show little sign of abating in 2017,"" Amy Bensted, the firm's head of hedge fund products, said in a statement. ""This is undoubtedly a concern for firms in terms of both retaining capital and fundraising over the year.""Indeed, investors indicated a strong likelihood that they'll be putting their cash to work elsewhere.For 2017, 38 percent of those surveyed said they are planning on reducing cash allocations, the highest level recorded in data going back to 2009. Those willing to maintain their current allocation numbered 43 percent, while only 20 percent plan to increase, with both numbers being at their lowest in the data set as well.However, the attitude towards hedge funds depends on strategy.The group most out of favor with investors is funds of funds, which hold portfolios of other funds rather than invest in their own strategies. Of that group, 29 percent say they will decrease exposure, while only 13 percent plan to increase.Activist fund managers—think Carl Icahn, Dan Loeb or Bill Ackman—also got poor marks, with 20 percent planning to decrease exposure and no investors planning to increase. Activists actually did well in 2016, collectively gaining 10.4 percent against the S&P 500's 10 percent increase and an industry wide return of just 5.4 percent, according to Hedge Fund Research Inc (HFRI), a fund research and data firm.The strategy likely to pull in the most money proportionately is relatively value, for which 26 percent of investors plan to increase allocation, with only 6 percent expecting to cut.Despite the likelihood that cash will be leaving, the industry can expect to see more funds introduced after a decline in 2016. Preqin said 37 percent of respondents said they plan on launching new funds, two-thirds of whom indicated that would happen in the first quarter.Total funds fell 2.3 percent last year to 9,893, according to HFRI.",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/26/hedge-fund-hate-more-cash-likely-to-flow-out-again-this-year.html

			                 ",2017,02,15," Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn increased his holdings in Herbalife and Hertz Global Holdings in the fourth quarter, and exited Voltari.New York-based Icahn also reduced investments in PayPal, Nuance Communications, and Freeport-McMoRan, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday. Other holdings remained unchanged as of Dec. 31.Icahn recently took on a role as special adviser to President Donald Trump, after publicly endorsing the real estate executive's candidacy in September 2015.Icahn, who rose to fame in the 1980s as a corporate raider and has rebranded himself as an activist investor and outspoken shareholder advocate, has been increasing his stake in Herbalife in a public feud with hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who has shorted the distributor of nutrition supplements.As of Dec. 31, Icahn increased his stock share stake in Herbalife by 14.7 percent to 22.5 million shares. Additionally, Icahn increased his stock share stake in Hertz Global by 126.2 percent to 29.3 million shares.Conversely, Icahn slashed his stock share stake in Freeport-McMoran by 12.3 percent to 91.2 million class B shares. Freeport's share price rose 94.8 percent in 2016.Icahn's publicly traded holding company Icahn Enterprises agreed in December to sell its American Railcar Leasing to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp.The quarterly disclosures of manager stock holdings, known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are always intriguing for investors trying to divine a pattern in what savvy traders are selling and buying.But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some peril because the disclosures are backward looking, coming out 45 days after the end of each quarter.Still, the records offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, bets that a stock will fall in price. There is little disclosure on bonds and other securities that do not trade on exchanges.Soros Fund Management buys new stakes in financialsSoros gets out of gold, Paulson cuts SPDR Gold sharesBuffett's Berkshire takes huge bite of Apple shares, boosts airline stakesBets on financials, pharma power US hedge funds' strong start to year",https://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/15/icahn-raises-stakes-in-herbalife-hertz-cuts-freeport-mcmoran-in-4q.html
"        CSX shares see best day in 36 years amid reported activist interest
			                 ",2017,01,19,"   Hunter Harrison is stepping down as CEO of Canadian Pacific  Railway and partnering with activist investor Paul Hilal in  an effort to put Harrison into CSX's senior management, The Wall Street Journal reported  Wednesday.   Hilal launched his activist fund Mantle Ridge after leaving  William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management last year.  Mantle has raised more than $1 billion for a single investment, a  source familiar with the matter told the Journal.  CSX shares leaped 23 percent, their best daily performance since Nov. 3, 1980,  when shares climbed 21.15 percent. Shares hit an all-time high in  morning trade.  Harrison is departing as CEO five months earlier than originally  scheduled. Canadian Pacific's President and Chief Operating  Officer Keith Creel will take on the role starting January  31.   Additionally, CSX reported earnings on Tuesday, missing profit  estimates by a penny at 49 cents per share, though revenue topped  expectations, according to Thomson Reuters consensus estimates.  The company said it remains optimistic due to improving business  conditions, citing a stronger U.S. dollar and low commodity  prices.   The railroad company's stock is currently leading the Dow Jones  transportation average, which briefly climbed more than 1  percent Thursday, outperforming the broader markets.A spokesman for CSX said in a statement the company is open to the views of all its shareholders and will ""actively evaluate"" those of Mantle Ridge.   ""Likewise its Board and management  team remain supportive of the Company's strategic growth  strategy, which has started to deliver sustainable value for  shareholders,"" said CSX spokesman Gary Sease.Sease said CSX looks forward to discussing strategies for driving earnings growth and shareholder value with all its shareholders.  Harrison's communications team said they had nothing to add  beyond a Wednesday press release announcing the CEO changes at  Canadian Pacific.  Mantle Ridge and Canadian Pacific did not  immediately respond to CNBC requests for comment.

"        Valeant CEO will listen if there's 'inbound interest' in core businesses
			                 ",2016,12,15,"   Chairman and CEO Joseph Papa told CNBC on Thursday he would  ""have to listen at this time"" if there is ""inbound interest"" in  some of Valeant  Pharmaceuticals' core businesses.  Shares of the embattled pharmaceuticals company fell as much as  7.9 percent Thursday after Morgan Stanley downgraded the  stock to equal weight from overweight. In a note, the  firm said it was incorrect in its August thesis that the  debt-ridden company's business would stabilize and asset sales  would enhance value. Papa said in an exclusive interview on  CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that he would consider selling some of  Valeant's core businesses and assets, against the wishes of some  of the company's major shareholders.  ""We, as you know, have some significant amount of  debt — we have $30 billion of debt. I always said that  we're going to build around this core,"" he said. ""If, though,  there is inbound interest that comes to us and says, 'We'd be  very interested in some of these great assets you have,' I have  to listen at this time.""  Papa described Valeant's ""core"" businesses as: dermatology, the  gastrointestinal business, the eye health Bausch & Lomb  business and the consumer business. His view on potentially  selling Valeant's core businesses has sometimes, however,  been at odds with some of his major shareholders.  One of the company's largest shareholders, John Paulson, was  against a proposed Salix transaction in November. At the  time, Valeant shares spiked as much as 36 percent  after the company said it was discussing selling its  gastrointestinal drug, Salix, to Takeda Pharmaceuticals. In a  statement last month, Valeant said it was discussing ""various  divestitures, including, but not limited to, Salix"" with third  parties.  Outspoken shareholder Bill Ackman also had said  earlier in the year that Valeant has no plans to sell its core  assets like its eye health Bausch & Lomb segment. Ackman's  Pershing Square Capital Management has a 7.8 percent stake  in the pharmaceutical company. Ackman has said in the past  that he regrets his initial investment in the company, which  is down more than 85 percent year to date.  Another factor that's affected pharmaceutical stocks has been the  expected amount of drug price regulation from the government.  Since the election, specialty pharmaceutical companies Valeant,  Teva and Allergan have all fallen. Mylan is up 2  percent, however.  Looking ahead to next year, Papa said he has recently been  focused on assembling a team to move the company forward. He  noted that Valeant has a psoriasis drug at the FDA currently  awaiting approval, and he hopes to move that into the market  soon.   — CNBC's Christine Wang contributed to this  report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/15/valeant-ceo-will-listen-if-theres-inbound-interest-in-core-businesses.html
"        Mondelez shares climb on report of proposed Kraft-Heinz acquisition
			                 ",2016,12,14,"   Shares of Mondelez International spiked as much as 12 percent  in extended trade Wednesday after a report surfaced that Kraft-Heinz is planning to acquire the snack giant.  Bloomberg News reported the merger talk, citing Swiss economic  magazine Bilanz.  The cookie maker pared its gains and was up less than 6 percent  after Reuters reported, citing sources, that Mondelez has not  heard from Kraft-Heinz. Mondelez told CNBC that it does not  comment on market rumors or speculations.  Mondelez separated from Kraft in 2012 and has focused on  widening its profit margins by reducing costs through  divestitures and asset sales. It is currently in the middle  of a $3 billion cost saving program, which runs through 2018.  In June, the Hershey board unanimously rejected an offer from  Mondelez to acquire the company. At the time, observers  speculated Mondelez was seeking the merger in order to remain an  independent company and not become a target for acquisition  itself. Mondelez had been under pressure from activist investor  William Ackman to either grow revenue faster or sell  itself to a rival.  Kraft-Heinz declined to comment to CNBC.  Kraft-Heinz shares gained about 3 percent in extended trade,  following the news. Mondelez shares are down a little more than 4  percent year to date, but up slightly more than 3 percent in the  past month. —Reuters and CNBC's Christina Cheddar Berk contributed  to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/14/mondelez-soars-after-report-that-kraft-heinz-is-planning-to-acquire-it.html

"        Cramer Remix: The drug stock that's 'downright toxic' for your portfolio
			                 ",2016,11,09,"   As Jim Cramer digested the stunning victory of Donald  Trump, he realized the stock market would suddenly become a  very different place with different sectors leading the charge.  ""The biggest impact of this shocking election is probably on the  healthcare group,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.  For over a year, the prospect of Hillary  Clinton winning the White House has weighed on drug  stocks, especially after she tweeted about cracking down on  pharmaceutical price gouging in September of 2015.  But with a Trump regime entering Washington, those worries have  pretty much been taken off the table. The Republicans are all  about limited regulation and free markets. Thus, Cramer doesn't  expect them to crack down on drug pricing because it would stifle  innovation.  ""For the segments of the health care sector that don't have price  wars, I think we need to get a lot more positive because these  stocks have more room to run,"" Cramer said.  Cramer warned to also stay away from Valeant's ugly  balance sheet that made the stock ""downright toxic,"" and while CVS seemed to  have headwinds after reporting a mixed quarter, he thinks most of  the weakness is CVS-specific.  Many investors were confused as to why stocks entered a mini-bear  market and then a bull market within the same 24 hour period  following the news of Donald Trump's  election into presidency on Wednesday.Cramer broke down what happened for investors in plain  English. After all, he was also puzzled.  ""The simple fact is there were a heck of a lot more people who  wanted in after this election than wanted out, and a gigantic  number of hedge funds who were on the wrong side of the trade and  had to reverse their stance,"" he said.  Cramer doesn't want to throw cold water on the rally, but he's  willing to bet that investors won't be talking about Donald Trump  or Hillary Clinton by next week.  ""I'm saying that we will be stuck in a world of some unknowns  that will be a source of anxiety, and therefore selling,"" Cramer  said.  Once the euphoria dies down, Cramer expects focus to once again  resume on the Federal Reserve, mergers and whether Trump will  convince Congress to kill NAFTA. Investors will worry about who  will be chosen as Treasury Secretary, a possible trade war in  China and the price of oil.  Soon, these realities could be very sobering for investors.  ""So, don't get cocky. Relief rallies don't last when faced with a  new set of facts, unless they are positive. Otherwise, they just  tend to fade away,"" Cramer said.  With talks between Chipotle Mexican Grill and hedge fund  billionaire Bill Ackman intensifying recently,  Chipotle's CFO Jack Hartung shed light on the discussions  to Cramer on Wednesday.  ""The dialogue we have had with Pershing has talked about driving  long-term shareholder value. Talks about recovering the business  model and from what they have said so far, they believe that  Chipotle is a special brand we are going through a tough time  right now,"" Hartung told the ""Mad Money"" host.  Ackman took a nearly 10 percent stake in the company two months  ago, but did not disclose his strategy. Chipotle also recently  hired a law firm, investment banks and public relations company  to help engage with the billionaire. Carrizo Oil & Gas recently joined the club of oil  companies on Cramer's favored list that sell their own stock to  make smart acquisitions to take advantage of lucrative drilling  real estate.  Carrizo is a $2.2 billion independent exploration and production  company with operations in the Eagle Ford shale, the Permian  Delaware Basin in Texas, Utica shale in Ohio, Marcellus shale in  Pennsylvania and Niobrara formation in Colorado.  In late October, Carrizo bought 15,000 acres in the Eagle Ford  shale from Sanchez Energy for $181 million in cash. In order to  pay for the deal, it priced a 6 million share secondary offering  at $37.50. While the stock pulled back initially, it bounced back  to close at $37.35 on Wednesday, and recently reported a strong  quarter.  Cramer spoke with Carrizo's CEO Chip Johnson, who commented on  the positive nature of Republicans for business.  ""I think the Republicans are always going to be a little bit more  business friendly than the Democrats, so that can work out to our  advantage and maybe some of these pipelines will get built that  will reduce rail traffic,"" Johnson said.  In the lightning round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller  favorite stocks: Extra Space  Storage: ""No, rates are going higher.

"        Chipotle exec sheds light on conversations with billionaire Bill Ackman
			                 ",2016,11,09,"   With talks between Chipotle Mexican Grill and hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman intensifying recently, Chipotle's CFO Jack Hartung shed light on the discussions to Jim Cramer on Wednesday.  ""The dialogue we have had with Pershing has talked about driving  long-term shareholder value. Talks about recovering the business  model and from what they have said so far, they believe that  Chipotle is a special brand we are going through a tough time  right now,"" Hartung told the ""Mad Money"" host.  Ackman took a nearly 10 percent stake in the company two months  ago, but did not disclose his strategy. Chipotle also recently  hired a law firm, investment banks and public relations company  to help engage with the billionaire.  ""They want just like everyone else to see us recover our sales,  recover our business. And if we do that we are going to get back  to our stock price, and then add shareholder value from there.""  All shareholders are aligned, and management has been disappointed with the amount of time that it has taken for the burrito chain to  recover from various health scares that took down the stock last  year, Hartung said.While Hartung admitted that the goals for Chipotle are stretched  for next year, he was confident that the company could achieve  them. The goals were based on feedback from investors who  expressed that they wanted clearer visibility into sales and  margin trends, and an understanding of the earnings potential  based on current sales levels.  Chipotle plans to deliver 20 percent margin and $10 of earnings per share by implementing efficiency on food and labor  costs, normalizing promo costs and renegotiating contracts for  supplies.  ""They are not going to be easy targets, but we thought we owed it  to our shareholders to put something out there in terms of what  we can deliver,"" Hartung said.  Questions for Cramer?

			                 ",2016,11,02,"   It's official: Hedge fund titan Bill Ackman is moving Pershing Square Capital to a new neighborhood.  His firm next year will take up residence in a West Side  building, part of an area of Manhattan that's being transformed into an  office and restaurant hub. The new digs will put Ackman in a  67,000-square-foot space at 787 11th Ave., between 54th and 55th  streets.  The move has been expected for a while, but the lease  finalization was announced Wednesday by the Georgetown Company,  which has secured a $349.5 million construction loan and is  partnering with Ackman on the deal. Pershing's relocation likely  will be complete by late 2017.Ackman's firm is now at 888 Seventh Ave., south of Central  Park and in an office that provides a panoramic view of the city. The new property comes with a lower rent that will help the firm save money, a source familiar with the matter said.  ""Hell's Kitchen is a great live, work, play community with  wonderful restaurants, services, transportation options and  entertainment,"" Adam Flatto, CEO of The Georgetown Company, said  in a statement. ""This is a neighborhood that will continue  to grow and we're pleased to welcome Pershing Square to the  building.""  There are big plans for the building, which sits across the  street from Dewitt Clinton Park and about a block from Hudson  River Park, a popular getaway and exercise area for New Yorkers.  The upper levels are being transformed into modern offices with  oversized floor plans, 24-foot-high ceilings in certain areas and  a 12,000-square-foot rooftop amenity, according to Georgetown.

Chipotle  has also hired crisis public relations firm Joele Frank, they added.Neither Ackman nor his New York-based hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, have publicly made any demands of Chipotle  after becoming its second-largest shareholder last month.Billionaire Ackman is known for buying stakes in publicly traded companies and trying to force changes ranging from removing board members to selling off large parts of the company.The sources asked not to be identified because the assignments  are not public.

"        Advice from three of the world's most successful investors
			                 ",2016,10,18,"   Where and how to find yield has become a common theme in this  market.  The main indexes hit record highs last quarter but political  uncertainty, an indecisive Fed, and tightening margins have all  caused swings for stocks.  These factors have led investors to question if now is the time  to buy or stay on the sidelines.   The uncertainty was echoed Monday on CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" by three of the biggest voices in  investing — Carl Icahn, chairman of  Icahn Enterprises, DoubleLine Capital's CEO Jeffrey Gundlach and  Appaloosa Management founder David Tepper weighed in on where  they see opportunity and how they are positioning themselves now.  When it comes to the market, Tepper said he is ""cautious,"" but not  ""outright bearish.""  Right now he thinks returns are OK, but the outcome of the  election could change that.  ""The market will move in different ways"" he said, depending on  who wins the White House and who wins Congress.  The election's impact will also be felt in the credit market, as  Tepper said its outcome will determine whether or not the  Federal Reserve raises benchmark interest rates this  December.   He said the economy is ""at a point where they [the  Federal Reserve] should raise rates,"" but if the market reacts  negatively after the election, the Fed could be forced to once  again leave rates unchanged.Icahn agreed with Tepper when it comes to being cautious. ""A lot of S&P companies are way overvalued  considering the risk premium,"" he said.  Icahn said that finding opportunity in this market is difficult  but there are companies that are ""uniquely undervalued"" like  Cheniere, AIG and Xerox — all major holdings in his  portfolio.    Icahn added that embattled Herbalife is also ""undervalued"" despite its  45 percent rally from the February 2016 low and a trade that has worked  against his rival, short-seller Bill Ackman of Pershing Square.     ""Bill Ackman [is] completely wrong,"" Icahn insisted. ""I think  Herbalife will be the mother of all short squeezes.""  Shares of Herbalife are up more than 80 percent since Ackman made his  now famous presentation in December 2012.  Never one to shy away from controversy, Icahn is standing by GOP  nominee Donald Trump.  ""I still support Donald Trump,"" Icahn told CNBC. ""I'm not saying  he's running a campaign the way I would run it, and I've said to  him that he needs to stick to the issues.""  Federal Election Commission data show that Icahn donated  $150,000 to Trump's campaign in September. DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach also believes we're in a  period of market uncertainty. But unlike Tepper, he doesn't  believe the election is to blame.  ""I actually don't think the election outcome is really all that  important because I think both candidates will be caught up in  the trend of fiscal stimulus and supporting fiscal stimulus,"" he  told CNBC.  Gundlach also said the credit market is signaling investors to be  cautious.   ""I would turn particularly negative if the S&P closed twice  below 2,130,"" he said. Hours after he spoke, it closed at 2,126.50 on Monday.  On the Fed, Gundlach believes Chair Janet Yellen may want to  run a ""high-pressure economy,"" and keep interest rates lower  until unemployment reaches close to 4 percent.   He said the bond market is sniffing out fiscal stimulus,  which means there could be an unfriendly environment for credit  investors ahead.  Overall, Gundlach said, the days of negative interest rates are  numbered and investors should expect steeper yield curves in the  future.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/18/advice-from-three-of-the-worlds-most-successful-investors.html

"        The MOST epic moment at this year's Delivering Alpha was ...
			                 ",2016,09,16,"   Delivering alpha as a concept is all about beating the market, so  the same is true for Delivering Alpha as a conference: It's all  about giving investors the information they need to maximize  returns.  Over the years, the conference has served its audience well,  providing dozens of stock picks that helped investors get returns  over and above what they would receive from putting money in a  basic index fund.  It's not an easy business topping, for instance, the   or other major market benchmarks. In recent years, only about 1  in 4 large-cap stock pickers beat their benchmarks, and this year  it's only about 15 percent, the worst ever, according to Bank of  America Merrill Lynch.  So when you find someone who's got a track record of actually  delivering alpha, it's worth a listen.  Bill Miller is one of those people, though his star has faded in  recent years. Building his reputation as a fund manager at Legg  Mason, he beat the S&P 500 a stunning 15 years in a row from  1991 through 2005. But Miller had a rough time during the Great  Recession, and this year he recently left Legg Mason to join LMM.  So when you combine an investing legend with a super-aggressive  call on a stock that is taking a beating not only in share price  but also public perception, you get a moment that well could end  up being the most epic of the 2016 version of Delivering Alpha. (A list of the five best moments is here.)Miller's boldest call came with his choice of Valeant. The  pharmaceutical company has seen its shares plunge more than 73  percent in 2016 amid severe criticism for jacking up the prices dramatically on several of its drugs.   Despite the headwinds, Miller smells opportunity.  ""We think with Valeant right now, it's a completely different  company,"" Miller said at the conference. ""It's just a slow-growth  specialty pharma company that will generate a lot of free cash  and you should be able to make, I think, 25 to 30 percent on  Valeant over the next five years.""  His office later confirmed that he  meant each of those five years.  The call will be interesting to watch. Miller has hedge fund  titan Bill Ackman on his side, with the head of Pershing Square  Capital making a $3.3 billion bet on the company.   On the other side of the fence is fellow hedge fund giant Jim  Chanos, who said during a CNBC interview on the sidelines of  Delivering Alpha that he is short Valeant and not planning on  covering his position anytime soon.  Miller made two other notable calls at the conference: long the  S&P 500 and short the benchmark 10-year Treasury note.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/16/the-most-epic-moment-at-this-years-delivering-alpha-was.html
"        You missed it: 5 epic moments from Delivering Alpha
			                 ",2016,09,14,"   Nobody hugged it out on stage, but Jim Chanos did get a travel  invitation. The word of the day was ""danger."" And Donald Trump  got a few shoutouts, not all of them kind.  In sum, it was another action-packed and unpredictable day at the  Delivering Alpha conference, presented for the sixth time Tuesday  by CNBC and Institutional Investor.  Epic moments abounded. But we broke it down to five that,  if you weren't there, well, you missed it: Anyone for Trump? Anyone? Bueller? Icahn?   Investors during one panel discussion were asked if they had met  Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, and several raised  their hands. When Avenue Capital's Marc Lasry then asked the room  how many would do business with Trump, no one raised a hand. Not.  One. Person. At least among panel members, there seemed to be not  a lot of support for either candidate, though the Trump moment  stood out. (The audience was asked the same question regarding  Hillary Clinton, and a smattering raised their hands.) Later in the  day, Trump got a little boost when Carl Icahn  urged support for the New York real estate tycoon, whom he said would be better for the  economy. Delivering 'danger'  The conference ostensibly is supposed to generate ideas to beat  the market. But for many in attendance, the prospects are  gloomy. Paul Singer of Elliott Management warned that this is ""a  very dangerous time"" for investors. Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio said the bond market is ""in a dangerous situation."" Icahn said it is  ""very dangerous"" in the market. And there were others, all  warning that these are perilous times indeed. Hey Jim, come out and see me sometime  Short-seller Chanos has repeatedly  criticized Alibaba, and on Tuesday he bashed the  Chinese e-commerce giant's logistics arm and its accounting.  Alibaba executive vice chairman Joseph Tsai responded later in the  day, saying Chanos has withstood ""pain"" shorting his  company's stock and invited him to Alibaba's headquarter to  better understand the business. Pain? That's one word for it.  Chanos, in fact, has gotten absolutely clobbered on this bet.  Since he announced his short at a Nov. 6  conference, shares are up about 22 percent. Somewhere, Bill Ackman was smiling (however  briefly)  Of the smattering of stock picks that took place, Bill Miller's  call on Valeant was easily the boldest.  Miller, chief investment officer at LMM, said he thinks the embattled drugmaker is ""a completely  different company"" than the one that was under severe  fire for jacking up drug prices, and could see returns of 25  percent to 30 percent per year over the next  five years. That would be quite a turnaround, considering  shares are off 73 percent this year and nearly 88 percent over  the past 12 months. It also would be music to Bill Ackman's ears. Ackman's Pershing  Square Capital has a 6.2 percent stake in the company —  a $3.3 billion bet that was worth as of Wednesday afternoon $618  million. (Shares were up 0.7 percent in afternoon trading.) But ... Uncle Carl gives Ackman an elbow  Ackman wasn't at this year's conference, but his presence was  felt in multiple years. Remember when he and Icahn hugged out their differences at  the 2014 gathering? Yeah, well, forget about it. Icahn denied the  two were feuding again per se (despite some incendiary comments he made  to CNBC.com a few weeks ago). But as the day's final speaker, he  couldn't leave the stage without blowing one more kiss at Ackman:  Icahn disclosed that he has now asked his company for permission  to take up to a 50 percent stake in Herbalife, the supplement company  over which the two have battled so publicly. And, of course,  nothing Icahn does in investing circles goes unnoticed. Herbalife  shares gained a couple percent in after-hours trading Tuesday and  rose 3.5 percent Wednesday.

Before the latest survey, brand perceptions had  nosed into positive territory for the first time since last year.The survey was carried out the same day investor William Ackman  disclosed after the market close that his hedge fund had  purchased a 9.9 percent stake in Chipotle, buying in after the  once high-flying company was battered by food-safety issues.""For at least some consumers, the outbreaks from last year still  resonate and for those consumers, eating in a Chipotle even today  is not worth the risk,"" said Ted Marzilli, YouGov BrandIndex's  chief executive officer.Chipotle has given away millions of free burritos and other menu  items, including guacamole and chips, to revive sales growth  after outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus linked to  its outlets last year put off customers.In July, the company reported an uptick in comparable sales for  the month but said it had a bigger-than-expected drop in such  sales in the quarter ended June 30.Ackman's fund said in a regulatory filing that Chipotle was  undervalued.Chipotle's own research on consumer perceptions shows ""the  overall trend is moving in the right direction,"" a spokesman  said. ""Week-to-week fluctuations will always occur, but we tend  to focus on longer-term trends,"" he said.YouGov said it interviews 4,800 people each weekday in the United  States for its polls, with participants drawn from an online  panel of more than 1.8 million people.On Tuesday, 4.5 percent more people said they had a negative  rather than positive perception of Chipotle's brand, according to  its data.Consumer opinions dropped in the last quarter of 2015, with 31.2  percent more people saying in late December that they had a  negative rather than positive perception of Chipotle's brand,  according to YouGov.Brand perceptions have since improved steadily but remain below  last summer, prior to the food-safety problems.Regarding quality, 4.8 percent more people said they felt  positive rather than negative about Chipotle on Tuesday,  according to YouGov.

"        Bill Ackman off Canadian Pacific board, ends four-year tenure
			                 ",2016,09,07,"   Activist investor William Ackman left the board of Canadian  Pacific on Tuesday, marking the end of a four-year tenure that  helped overhaul the ailing railroad company and earn his hedge  fund roughly $2.6 billion.Canadian Pacific announced Ackman's resignation almost exactly  one month after his Pershing Square Capital Management sold its  remaining 9.8 million CP shares, freeing up roughly $1.5 billion  in cash to make other investments.  Ackman initially planned to stay on the CP board until next year,  but stepped off now as the company was making other changes to  the board by adding Jill Denham and William Fatt.  ""I am confident that with CP's superb management and strong  governance, it will extend its remarkable track record into the  future,"" Ackman said in a statement announcing his  departure.  Late last year, Ackman played a key role Canadian Pacific's  efforts to buy rival railroad Norfolk Southern, an effort that  eventually collapsed.  The resignation marks the end of one of Ackman's most profitable  and successful investments. But it also comes at a time the  prominent activist investor is facing double-digit losses in his  highly concentrated investment portfolio.  By leaving the CP board, Ackman will gain time to devote to work  as a board member at Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Howard Hughes, a  developer and operator of master planned communities.  Pershing Square mounted one of the hedge fund industry's most  bitter and closely watched proxy battles at Canadian Pacific and  won seven seats on the company's 16-member board in 2012. Earlier  this year, former Pershing Square partner Paul Hilal, who had  been a key architect of the investment, resigned from CP's board  when he left Ackman's hedge fund.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/09/07/ackman-off-canadian-pacific-board-ends-four-year-tenure.html

"        Icahn: Ackman is backed into a corner on Herbalife
			                 ",2016,08,30,"   Billionaire investor Carl Icahn rejected any assertion Tuesday that he is  backed into a corner on troubled nutritional supplement company  Herbalife.  In fact, he said it's his long-time rival, Bill Ackman, who has the far more  tenuous position.  ""If anyone should feel boxed in, it's Ackman,"" Icahn said in an  exclusive interview with CNBC.com. ""Ackman is an astute student  of the market, as I am, and I think he would probably agree that  there is very rarely, if ever, a company with the short interest, as  it was just announced of 27.2 million shares of the 92 million  shares outstanding. Of the 92 million, there are 20 percent to 25  percent that are closely held.""""The only time you see the ratio very close to that is in companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy,"" he added. ""Obviously, Herbalife is not anywhere near that position, and is in fact growing dramatically in countries such as China.""  The statement comes days after Icahn upped his stake in Herbalife  by 2.3 million shares, bringing his total holdings to 19.3  million shares with a market value of some $1.7 billion. Shares  rose immediately after the Friday revelation, but have tailed  since, down about 4 percent this week.  Icahn remains committed to his position. It's part of a broader  story that features a long-simmering feud between him and Ackman,  the head of Pershing Square Management, which had taken a $1  billion short position against Herbalife  The two famously squared off in a shout-down on CNBC back in  January 2013, then seemed to reconcile at the 2014 Delivering  Alpha conference, an event presented annually by CNBC and  Institutional Investor.  Icahn's increased stake also occurred after Ackman had speculated  on whether Icahn was preparing to sell.  The statements from Icahn to CNBC.com Tuesday indicate the battle  may be back on.  ""I don't believe any professional short-sellers would ever take  a position in a company with these numbers,"" Icahn said. ""As the  old saying goes, fools will go where angels fear to tread.""  A representative for Pershing Square declined to comment.  Herbalife officials did not immediately respond to a request for  comment.  Icahn earlier this summer was granted the right to purchase up to  35 percent of Herbalife's shares. However, The Wall Street  Journal reported last week that Jefferies had been shopping for  buyers of what had been an 18 percent stake that Icahn was  holding.  Analysts are watching the drama closely for what happens next.  ""It's hard to say exactly what Carl Icahn's endgame is here,""  said Peter Cohn, an analyst at Height Analytics who covers  Herbalife. ""For now, we have to take it at face value that he is  sticking around, and I think that is positive for the  company.""

"        Herbalife may have misled investors, SEC on impact of FTC deal, short-seller says
			                 ",2016,08,29,"   After U.S. multi-level marketing company Herbalife settled a  probe of its sales practices with the U.S. Federal Trade  Commission last month, top executives assured investors that the  company would be able to thrive under the new rules.The consumer protection agency had questioned the company's sales  methods.Billionaire investor William Ackman in 2012 claimed the company  was running a pyramid scheme, recruiting members with a promise  of payment for enrolling others in distribution, rather than  depending on the actual sale of its nutritional supplements and  weight management products.In its July 15 settlement Herbalife agreed to restructure its  U.S. business so distributors are rewarded for sales rather than  for recruitment of sales agents and it agreed to pay a $200  million fine.  But Herbalife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission painted a much less optimistic picture than its  presentation to analysts and investors, according to a private  investor who flagged the differences to the SEC this month.  Matthew Handley, an investor based in Lakewood Ranch, Florida  alleged Herbalife made ""purposefully deceptive statements"" in its  Aug. 3 quarterly earnings conference call and regulatory  filings.  Handley, who is betting Herbalife's stock price will fall, told  Reuters about his outreach to the SEC and provided a copy of his  letter to its whistleblower office.  ""The transcript of the conference call, when compared directly  against the actual language the company issued in their 10Q,  depict a clear pattern of purposeful intent to deceive investors  and the market,"" Handley wrote in the Aug. 16 letter.  ""The things you say on the call and write in the filing have to  match up, and I thought they just didn't,"" he later said in an  interview with Reuters.  Because Herbalife's conference call transcript and its SEC  filings are publicly available, securities law experts said the  company probably did not violate the SEC's disclosure rules such  as Regulation FD.  Corporate filings are often more legalistic and technical than  what executives say during presentations to analysts and  investors, when they may sound optimistic about the company's  outlook, law professors and private lawyers noted.  But such presentations are usually highly scripted, with  companies trying to ensure oral statements are not inconsistent  with their filings, and the difference in tone and substance in  Herbalife's case is noteworthy, securities lawyers said.  ""Securities laws say that you cannot lie,"" said Yale law  professor Jonathan Macey. ""Reading these two documents (the  filing and transcript of the conference call), would suggest  they've changed their point of view,"" he added.  Herbalife spokesman Alan Hoffman declined repeated requests from  Reuters for comment. Brian Lane, a partner at law firm Gibson  Dunn, which vets Herbalife's disclosures, did not respond to a  call or email seeking comment. Herbalife has disclosed inquiries  from the SEC and other government authorities in the past.  SEC spokesman John Nester also declined to comment.  Complying with the FTC  Herbalife hailed the FTC settlement as a victory for its business  model as the FTC said the company may have deceived hundreds of  thousands of people but stopped short of calling it a pyramid  scheme.  In August executives assured analysts and investors on a  conference call that Herbalife would suffer little financial  damage from the settlement.  Chief Executive Michael Johnson said, ""We have the greatest  confidence in our ability to comply with the agreement and  continue to grow our business in the U.S. and around the  world.""  Chief Financial Officer John DeSimone saw ""minimal disruption to  the business"" and President Desmond Walsh also struck an  optimistic tone, saying, ""The most important thing is that we  don't see any long-term impact in our business.""  Herbalife's SEC filing was more circumspect though, saying the  company does not currently expect the settlement to have a  ""long-term and materially adverse impact.""  However, the filing also noted ""there is no guarantee that we  will be able to fully comply with the consent order"" and that  ""the company's business and its member base, particularly in the  United States, may be negatively impacted.""  If Herbalife cannot comply with the consent order, ""this could  result in a material and adverse impact to the company's results  of operations and financial condition,"" the filing said.  Herbalife also noted the settlement's effect ""could be  significant."" Billionaires' target   Herbalife has until next year to comply with the July 15 order  from the Federal Trade Commission to restructure its U.S.  business.  It is not clear whether other short sellers and investors will  respond to Handley's accusations on inconsistency between the  company's verbal optimism and its more cautious SEC filings, some  experts said.  ""If you invest in this company, you will want to know what the  odds are of this FTC ruling screwing up their business,"" Yale Law  School professor Macey added.   Herbalife's stock price has gone on a wild ride over the last  four years when two billionaires began squaring off over its  future. After seeing a high around $81.00 in January 2014, the  stock fell to a low around $30.26 in January 2015 before  recovering to close at $60.50 on Friday.   Hedge fund manager William Ackman, who called Herbalife a pyramid  scheme, placed a $1 billion short bet but so far has suffered  some losses as the stock climbed.  On Friday in a letter to investors, Ackman also noted differences  between presentations to investors by Herbalife executives and  the company's official quarterly filing. In his letter, Ackman  wrote ""management's latest commentary is a continuation of prior  misrepresentations.""   Ackman and Handley, who registered his complaints about  Herbalife's communications with the SEC, both said they have  never spoken to each other and reached their conclusions  independently.  By contrast, in 2013 billionaire Carl Icahn expressed confidence  in Herbalife, becoming its biggest shareholder and named  directors to the board.   This week, Ackman and Icahn tangled anew when Ackman said an  investment bank approached him to try and sell some of Icahn's  shares, but on Friday, Icahn said he was buying shares, not  selling.  A key institutional owner, Fidelity, sold some of Herbalife's  shares in August, it said in a filing.

Sources tell CNBC that two financial firms, Jefferies and UBS, were working  independently to find a buyer for Icahn's massive stake in the nutritional supplement company, but nothing ever happened.These sources also said that, as recently as late last week, Icahn was bid  for a large block of his Herbalife position but chose not to  sell. In addition, Icahn never offered his  shares, they added.It's also possible that Icahn, a well-known poker enthusiast, was  simply shopping his shares to give the appearance that he was  looking to exit his position.  The billionaire had no comment when reached by CNBC on Saturday.  Icahn's position in Herbalife is worth more than a billion  dollars, shares which he started accumulating in late  2012. The price off the stock has soared in value over that period, as has Icahn's stake.On CNBC's ""Squawk Box"", Friday morning, Bill Ackman claimed he was  among the parties contacted by Jefferies about buying a small  portion of Icahn's shares.  Ackman claimed his long time  Herbalife nemesis was trying to sell his position ""because he  knows this thing is toast.""Yet Icahn ended up buying more instead, and said in a  statement on Friday that he never directly put in a sell order to  Jefferies, which a spokesperson at the firm confirmed to CNBC.     Icahn and Ackman have been battling over Herbalife for years.  Ackman is short the stock and has waged a public battle against  the company, while Icahn has taken the other side of the trade.In a letter announcing his Friday Herbalife purchase, Icahn tore  into Ackman.

			                 ",2016,08,26,"   Billionaire hedge fund boss Bill Ackman told CNBC on Friday the past 12 months were  the ""worst period of performance"" of his investment career, and the  implosion of Valeant Pharmaceuticals was mostly to blame.  ""It's almost entirely been driven by Valeant. I've never owned a  stock down 90 percent,"" the Pershing Square Capital  Management chief told ""Squawk Box,"" referring to Valeant's  plunge from a 52-week high of $245 per share to around $18 per  share in late June.  Since then Valeant has recovered to around $31 per share, as the  embattled drugmaker works to regain investor confidence after  questions about its pricing strategy and ties to a specialty  pharmacy led to wider political and regulatory scrutiny, and  hammered the stock.  Ackman, who joined the Valeant board in mid-March, said the  company is making progress. In addition to revamping its board,  Valeant earlier this year hired Joseph Papa, chief executive of  over-the-counter drug company Perrigo, as its new CEO to succeed longtime chief Michael Pearson. Valeant in August named Paul  Herendeen, an executive at animal drugmaker Zoetis, as its chief  financial officer.  ""[Valeant] is now a more traditional Pershing Square investment""  now that it's been pummeled, he said. ""We normally invest  when shareholders have lost confidence in management. And that's  what happened here. It was not just management, shareholders lost  confidence in the numbers. The financial statements were delayed.  There was a potential default.""  Ackman said he broke all his investment rules with Valeant,  initially striking up a partnership with the Canadian drugmaker  in 2014 to try to buy Botox-maker Allergan. The unique  arrangement raised questions at the time about a conflict of  interest, an assertion Ackman had dismissed.  ""We went off the reservation,"" he told CNBC on Friday, looking back  at those early days. ""We made one very big mistake taking a  passive position in Valeant.""  ""We never normally get to meet the management of a company before  making an investment. [And] we never invest in really complicated  companies you can't figure out from just reading the 10K  [filing],"" he said.  Actavis ultimately thwarted Valeant, and purchased Allergan last  year in a deal valued at $66 billion.  Once the Allergan deal was lost, Ackman stuck with Valeant in  hopes to strike other deals. ""We thought we could help, as we  attempted to do in the Allergan transaction, by creating other  potential merger opportunities. That was a big mistake.""  Ackman's Valeant comments Friday on ""Squawk Box"" were part of  a wide-ranging interview that also dealt with the billionaire's Herbalife short. The Pershing Square founder said he was approached to purchase Carl  Icahn's stake in the nutritional supplement firm.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/26/bill-ackman-we-made-one-very-big-mistake-with-valeant-and-lost-big-time.html
"        Bill Ackman: Carl Icahn looks to sell Herbalife because 'he knows this is toast'
			                 ",2016,08,26,"   Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman told CNBC on Friday he was  approached indirectly by Carl Icahn to purchase the  billionaire's stake in Herbalife — Ackman's longtime short target.  Asked why Icahn would want to sell his stake in Herbalife,  Ackman responded:  ""I think he knows this is toast"" and ""he's made bunch of  money."" Herbalife shares slumped about 4.5 percent Friday  after Ackman made his comments.Icahn said: ""I am not commenting on rumors and stories about what I am  doing.""  The Pershing Square Capital Management founder confirmed the gist  of a Wall Street  Journal report that Icahn was considering selling his stake in  Herbalife to a group including the nutritional supplement firm's  arch-nemesis Ackman.  Icahn ""came to me"" through investment bank Jefferies  Group with a proposal in early August to ""cover my short""  position,  Ackman said on ""Squawk Box.""  Saying no to Icahn at first, Ackman said he later reconsidered  for only for a few million shares. Icahn owns 17 million-plus  shares valued at around $1 billion.  Ackman said if he were to buy a small stake and sell it right  away, he would probably lose about $30 million. ""I would spend  $30 million to get Carl out. I would probably spend more.""  The Pershing Square chief is still betting against Herbalife  — short more than $1 billion on the stock. He's been  critical of Herbalife for years, calling it a pyramid scheme  — allegations the company denies.  ""This is a confidence game. Carl is what creates the confidence  in the company. If Carl sells, it can accelerate the demise of  the company,"" Ackman said. ""With Carl exiting, I think the  thing is over, and over quickly. The sooner he sells the  better.""  Last month, the Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement  with the nutritional supplements company that, while determining  Herbalife was not a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, called for the  company to change its operations.  ""This was a great FTC settlement in terms of the findings, in  terms of all the requirements. The requirements don't really take  effect until May. It is sort of a slower bleed as the top  distributors leave,"" Ackman told CNBC.  In 2014, Ackman and Icahn buried the hatchet in their  long-running feud at the CNBC/Institutional Investor Delivering  Alpha conference, with a hug on stage.  Icahn will be back this year at Delivering Alpha 2016,  produced by CNBC and Institutional Investor, which  will be held on Sept. 13 in New York.  Ackman first shorted Herbalife on May 1, 2012, and went public  with his position in December of that year.  ""Carl is great investor,"" Ackman told CNBC on Friday. ""You were right to buy with Carl at $32 a  share when he bought the stock. And you were right to sell with  Carl when he sells the stock.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/26/bill-ackman.html

			                 ",2016,08,26," Carl Icahn recently discussed selling his stake in dietary supplement company Herbalife to a group that included the company's biggest critic — and the activist investor's arch-rival — William Ackman, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday.In a further twist to the long-running feud between the two billionaires, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ that investment bank Jefferies Group LLC had been looking for buyers for Icahn's 18 percent stake, worth roughly $1 billion.  However, the status of the talks and the names of the other  investors weren't clear and the WSJ said that Icahn might  not sell anything.  Herbalife has been in the news thanks largely to a high-profile  war Ackman has waged against the company. With a billion-dollar  short in play, Ackman has contended that the company is engaged  in a pyramid scheme where its representatives benefit more from  recruiting new distributors than from actual sales.  However, last month the Federal Trade Commission reached a  settlement with the supplements company that, while determining  Herbalife was not a pyramid or Ponzi scheme, called for the  company to change its operations.

			                 ",2016,08,10,"  Check out which companies are making headlines before the  bell:   JD.com — The China-based online retailer reported a  surprise profit for its second quarter, despite a revenue  shortfall, thanks to a substantial improvement in profit margins.  Southwest Airlines — Southwest said current-quarter  revenue per available seat mile would fall more than expected  this quarter, owing to a July 20 computer outage that canceled  more than 2,000 flights.  Michael Kors — The luxury goods maker earned an  adjusted 88 cents per share for its latest quarter, 14 cents a share above estimates. Revenue also came in well above estimates. Comparable-store sales fell more than expected, however, and it gave a soft current-quarter forecast.  Walt Disney — Disney reported adjusted quarterly  profit of $1.62 per share, one cent a share above estimates. Revenue  also exceeded forecasts. Disney revenue at its movie studio  and theme parks divisions were better than expected, but  investors are focusing on a revenue miss at Disney's cable  networks business.  SunPower — SunPower lost 22 cents per share for its latest  quarter, two cents a share smaller than anticipated. The solar  panel maker reported better-than-expected revenue. The   company also said aggressive pricing by competitors is hurting  its near-term returns, however, and it plans to cut 1,200 jobs and slash its  CEO's salary to $1 for the rest of this year.  Tesla – Tesla said one of its cars operating in  ""autopilot"" mode had crashed in China, and is investigating the  incident. The driver claimed Tesla's sales staff sold that  function as ""self-driving.""  Yum Brands — The restaurant operator will receive a  petition from consumer groups today, calling on its KFC unit to  stop its suppliers from routinely using antibiotics on its  poultry.  Pacific Gas & Electric — The utility was found  guilty of federal charges in connection with a 2010 natural gas  pipeline explosion in California that resulted in eight deaths  and 58 injuries. PG&E could be liable for a  fine of up to $3 million.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals — Valeant was the subject of a  private shareholder dinner hosted by Bank of America in  late June, according to a Reuters report. The dinner was  attended by investor and Valeant board member Bill Ackman, and  came six weeks before Valeant reported earnings and unveiled a  reorganization plan Tuesday. The story said one analyst  questioned the propriety of the timing of that gathering.  Yelp – Yelp surprised the Street by reporting a  second-quarter profit of one cent per share, compared to  estimates of a seven cents per share loss. The customer  review website operator's revenue also exceeded analysts' forecasts, as does its current-quarter revenue forecasts. The upbeat outlook comes amid an increase in business and  consumer signups for Yelp's services, following an increase in  sales and marketing expenditures by the company.  Mylan — Mylan reported adjusted quarterly profit of  $1.16 per share, three cents a share above estimates. The drugmaker's revenue was essentially in line with forecasts. Mylan's results were helped by growth in its specialty and  generic drug sales.  SolarCity — SolarCity lost $2.32 per share for its  latest quarter, smaller than the $2.44 per share loss anticipated  by analysts. The solar equipment company's revenue easily  topped estimates. The company did say that closing new  project financing deals were delayed due to the takeover talks it  had been holding with Tesla.  The Container Store — The retailer reported a  quarterly loss of four cents per share, smaller than the 10 cents  per share loss forecast by analysts. Revenue, however, was  short of consensus, and the seller of household storage products  said it still had work to do in driving sales higher.  Sony — Sony announced a September 7 event involving  its PlayStation video-game console. Analysts said it's likely  Sony will unveil a successor to the PlayStation 4 at that event.  Fossil – Fossil earned 12 cents per share for its  latest quarter, beating estimates by three cents a share. The watch  maker's revenue also came in above forecasts. Profit was  substantially lower than the year before, however, and Fossil gave lower-than-expected guidance for the current quarter as sales of  traditional watches fall.

"        Bill Ackman made back $113 million today on Valeant jump
			                 ",2016,08,09," After a year of misery, Bill Ackman finally is having a pretty good month.The head of the Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund got some more good news Tuesday: Valeant shares surged on news that the company had received unsolicited offers for its core assets. In addition, the pharmaceutical firm earlier in the day reaffirmed its optimistic full-year guidance despite missing earnings expectations.Traders scooped up Valeant shares following the developments, boosting them more than 23 percent in afternoon trading. In rough numbers, that nets Ackman a profit of $113.4 million, based on the 22.6 million shares Pershing owns. Pershing is the company's largest shareholder, with 6.33 percent of shares outstanding, according to S&P Capital IQ.Ackman initially plucked down $3.3 billion on Valeant and increased his stake along the way for an investment that is now worth just $485 million.The news comes just days after Ackman announced that the firm was selling its shares in Canadian Pacific Railway. The sale netted his fund $1.5 billion.That's as far as the good news goes, though, for the $11.9 billion fund. Pershing is down 19 percent for the year, according to company documents, due in good part to an otherwise dismal run by Valeant, which has been dogged with problems since the collapse of a deal in which it would have merged with Allergan. Shares in Valeant  are down about 73 percent in 2016 and 89 percent over the past year. The company has faced intense criticism for massive price increases on certain drugs, and its unorthodox use of a specialty pharmacy.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/09/bill-ackman-made-back-113-million-today-on-valeant-jump.html
"        Before Valeant overhaul, Bill Ackman met investors at private brainstorming event
			                 ",2016,08,10,"   Six weeks before Valeant Pharmaceuticals revealed plans to reorganize and pay down debt, similar ideas to  improve the drugmaker's fortunes were discussed at a private  shareholder dinner attended by top investor and board member  William Ackman, according to a source who participated.Bank of America hosted the June 29 event, billed as Valeant: a  Bull/Bear dinner, at the Lincoln Ristorante in Manhattan,  according to two people who saw the invitation.Nearly two dozen mutual and hedge fund managers came to dine and  brainstorm on Valeant, according to the source, who was not at  liberty to speak publicly about it.  While Ackman had things to say, he came mostly to let others  discuss their concerns, attending largely in ""listen only mode,""  the source said.  Small dinners at which fund managers discuss the pros and cons of  an investment bet are common on Wall Street. But one Wall Street  analyst questioned the propriety of a private investor event with  a board member before Valeant was due to release quarterly  earnings on Tuesday.  Valeant's conduct is under particular scrutiny as it seeks to  clean up an image tarnished by federal investigations into its  drug pricing and accounting practices that cut its share price by  more than 90 percent in one year.  The event was first disclosed by Wells Fargo analyst David Maris,  a long-time critic of Valeant, in a note to clients on Monday.  Maris did not attend and could not provide details.  Company officials cannot share material information about their  business with a select group of investors, and are expected to  not discuss significant issues in the so-called ""quiet period""  several weeks before they report earnings.  Bank of America told invitees that Ackman would attend. He is  often a draw in investment circles and is an influential director  on Valeant's board.  Ackman's $12 billion hedge fund Pershing Square Capital  Management is Valeant's biggest investor and owns 21.6 million  shares or 6.3 percent of the company.  He came to the Bank of America event both as an owner and a board  member, the person who attended the dinner said.  The discussion focused on major challenges facing Valeant. In  particular, investors said the company must avert the possibility  of defaulting on its more than $30 billion in debt, the person  said. The possibility of a default has been looming since March  and is often discussed among investors.  The investors also raised more specific changes such as replacing  longtime investor and public relations chief Laurie Little and  making sure that Chief Executive Joseph Papa communicated better  during quarterly conference calls with investors than his  predecessor, the source said. Papa did not attend the meeting,  the source added.  Valeant on Tuesday said it would sell billions of dollars of  non-core assets and could accept buyout offers for its main  businesses as it seeks to restore investor trust. Its shares rose  more than 24 percent.  On Monday, Valeant announced new leadership for several key  businesses, and said Little was stepping down from the  company.  During a call with investors on Tuesday, Maris asked Papa about  the evening, saying a Valeant board member held a dinner where  selected Valeant owners were able to discuss things, adding that  this sounded like ""the same old Valeant"" to him.  ""I don't know the specifics so it would be speculation and I  don't want to add to that,"" Papa said in response.

"        Valeant maintains full-year forecast, shares surge 18%
			                 ",2016,08,09,"  Valeant  Pharmaceuticals reported quarterly earnings and revenue  that fell short of analysts' expectations on Tuesday,  but  stood by its full-year forecast as it tries to restore investor  confidence after facing a storm of criticism over its business  practices.  Shares of Valeant gained more than 25 percent on Tuesday.  CEO Joseph Papa told CNBC that Tuesday's price action reflects  increased confidence in the company as it stabilizes and returns  to growth. He added that he doesn't agree with speculations that Valeant may have to accept lower prices when it sells off non-core assets.""These assets we're considering to be sold are not going to be in a fire sale. They have real value to potential purchaser,"" Papa said. He added that he is ""very confident"" that Valeant will get ""fair market value"" for these assets.  Board member and activist investor Bill Ackman has previously said that  Valeant has no plans to sell core  assets like Bausch & Lomb.  The Canadian drugmaker in the past year has faced intense  political and investor scrutiny for its steep drug price  increases and unorthodox use of a specialty pharmacy.  Valeant, which has about $30.77 billion in debt, also had to  appease creditors after missing deadlines for filing financial  reports, triggering default notices.  The company posted second-quarter earnings of $1.40 per share on  $2.42 billion in revenue.  Analysts had expected the company to post earnings of $1.48 per  share on $2.46 billion in revenue, according to a Thomson Reuters  consensus estimate.Valeant said it still sees full-year 2016 adjusted earnings of $6.60 to $7.00 a share, versus a $6.53 a share estimate, on revenue of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion.  In July, CNBC reported that the embattled company's former CEO,  J. Michael Pearson, unloaded more of his personal holdings than  originally thought. Pearson sold nearly 5 million shares and  options for a total of $96.8 million. The news came on the same  day that the Sequoia Fund revealed it is completely out of the  stock. Sequoia was at one time the largest Valeant shareholder.  The Canadian drugmaker came under fire when The New York  Times reported that Valeant and other pharmaceutical  companies were using a network of specialty pharmacies to sustain  sales of their high-priced drugs and prevent patients and  insurers from switching to cheaper generic drugs. Citron Research  subsequently published a note calling Valeant the ""pharmaceutical  Enron.""  In response, Valeant formed an ad hoc committee to review the  allegations regarding specialty pharmacy Philidor RX Services.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating  the relationship between the two companies. — CNBC's Meg Tirrell, Christine Wang and Everett Rosenfeld, and Reuters contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/09/valeant-pharmaceuticals-reports-fiscal-second-quarter-earnings.html

"        Cramer Remix: This could make Apple roar higher
			                 ",2016,08,04,"   Jim Cramer says it is time for investors to acknowledge a new  dynamic in the market: in most industries, companies that make  the best use of the internet will win.  Cramer can pound the table on better earnings and stronger  revenues, but he knows it all comes down to survival in the end.  ""Their survival might very well depend on how well they are able  to integrate technology in general, and the web in particular,  because that is how you beat the competition,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said. Apple knows the importance of  digital, too. When CEO Tim Cook said the company's  service revenue stream will be as big as a Fortune 100 company by  next year, Cramer interpreted that as meaning Apple could  generate $30 billion in service revenue at a minimum, which could  prompt investors to pay more for the stock. Right now, Apple's  earnings streams are viewed as episodic, he said.  ""If the iPhone 7 is good, the stock can roar higher, but if the  new iPhone fails to impress, the stock goes back down to the  purgatory of the low $90s where this miraculous run started,""  Cramer said.  Cramer took one look at the stock action for Square and Herbalife on Thursday and knew it was short sellers covering their  positions.  ""Here is my new rule: try not to buy a stock that is in the  middle of a short squeeze, because even if you really like the  underlying company, you will almost always be able to get a  better price as long as you are patient,"" he said.  Shares of Herbalife spiked at the open on Thursday following a  better-than-expected earnings report. However, with 31 percent of  the stock affected by short sellers, Cramer expected fireworks  anyways. Management raised its full year earnings per share  guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to $4.80, which was an  increase from the initial expectation of $4.40 to $4.75.  But the real reason why short sellers will be covering their  positions has nothing to do with guidance.  Cramer suspects that it will be because Herbalife didn't fall  apart, despite the company's settlement with the Federal Trade  Commission last month that required it to change many of its  practices. Noted activist and short-seller Bill Ackman, head of  Pershing Square Capital, recently insinuated that the action  taken by the FTC had a larger impact than even Herbalife realizes, when he  stated on an investor call that ""Herbalife actually has been shut  down by the FTC, they just haven't realized it.""One executive that faced a much different challenge was Phil Knight. Early on, Nike's billionaire co-founder Knight had people telling him he wouldn't make it.  Yet, despite the haters, he still steered Nike to become the  world's No. 1 athletic-shoe company, with a brand so powerful it  can be recognized by a check mark.  Knight recently chronicled his journey of turning Nike into a $91  billion company in his memoir, ""Shoe Dog."" In an interview with Cramer on Thursday, Knight said that many doubted his  ability to succeed.  ""I've had a lot of people tell me, 'We ... think he's not going  to make it,'"" Knight said.  Given the market's strong run last month, Cramer knows it is hard  to find a large-cap stock that is still cheap on an earnings  basis. There was one company with big potential that stood out to  him that is trading at absurdly low levels right now —  Johnson Controls.  Johnson Controls has three divisions. One that makes heating  ventilation and air conditioners, a power solutions business that  supplies lead acid batteries, and an auto parts business.  In January, Johnson Controls announced it would buy the rump of  Tyco, a provider of security equipment, fire protection gear and  various safety products in a $16.5 billion deal. It was a tax  inversion transaction, as Tyco is based in Ireland. The deal is  expected to close in a little less than a month.  ""With the Tyco merger rapidly approaching, I think this is a good  time to buy some Johnson Controls,"" Cramer said. DexCom is the  company that makes glucose monitoring systems for people with  type-1 diabetes. Its technology transformed the way blood sugar  levels were checked when it introduced a sensor that can stick on  the skin, rather than pricking a finger.  And while it does have competition from companies like Medtronic,  DexCom's management has been adamant that it is not losing market  share. On Tuesday, the company reported a wider than expected  quarterly loss, even as its revenue was higher than expected, and  the stock fell.  Two weeks ago, an FDA panel voted in favor of approving DexCom's  monitoring system for non-adjunctive use, which means Medicare  and Medicaid could start covering its product. Cramer spoke with  DexCom's President and CEO Kevin Sayer, who outlined the  significance of the panel decision.  ""It could be very big. This is really the first medical device  ever approved for making insulin dosing decisions,"" Sayer said.  In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller  favorite stocks:  LendingClub Corp: ""Way too much risk. Come on my friend, I know  they're doing that reorganization and stuff, but I said I'm not  going to touch that one. Put together a couple of good quarters  and maybe I'll even think about it.""  W.P. Carey: ""On real estate investment trusts, we're recommending  Ventas and Federal Realty. That it, we're not going further.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/04/cramer-remix-this-could-make-apple-roar-higher.html
"        Cramer: What Square & Herbalife are really worth
			                 ",2016,08,04,"   Jim Cramer took one look at the stock action for Square and  Herbalife on Thursday and knew it was short sellers covering  their positions.  ""Here is my new rule: try not to buy a stock that is in the middle of a short squeeze, because even if you really like the underlying company, you will almost always be able to get a better price as long as you are patient,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.  Shares of Herbalife spiked at the open on Thursday following a  better-than-expected earnings report. However, with 31 percent of  the stock affected by short sellers, Cramer expected fireworks anyways.  Management raised its full year earnings per share guidance for 2016 to a range of $4.50 to  $4.80, which was an increase from the initial expectation of  $4.40 to $4.75.  But the real reason why short sellers will be covering their  positions has nothing to do with guidance.  Cramer suspects that it will be because Herbalife didn't fall  apart, despite the company's settlement with the Federal Trade  Commission last month that required it to change many of its  practices. Noted activist and short-seller Bill Ackman, head of  Pershing Square Capital, recently insinuated that the action  taken by the FTC had a larger impact than even Herbalife realizes, when he  stated on an investor call that ""Herbalife actually has been shut  down by the FTC, they just haven't realized it.""  Based on this commentary, Cramer believes that Ackman will now  double down on his negativity, rather than declaring victory that  he helped to clean up some of the practices for Herbalife.  ""He will do so, I believe, to prove that the FTC-mandated changes  are bad for business. That is why if you are going to play the  short game you have to come back to the fundamentals,"" Cramer  said.  With fundamentals in mind, Cramer struggled to determine what the  normalized earnings power should be for Herbalife. Earnings power  of $4.80 is impressive, but the company isn't as strong as  even Bristol-Myers Squibb, he said.  In the end, Herbalife is a supplements business. GNC currently trades at a  7 times multiple. Assuming Herbalife deserves double the  price-to-earnings multiple of GNC because of its faster growth  rate, Cramer calculated it is $67 a share. Herbalife closed at  $67 on Thursday.  ""You are dealing with a stock that seems fairly valued, which  means the only reason to own it here is because you're expecting  a short squeeze,"" Cramer said.  Investors that make that bet either believe Ackman will cover, or  Herbalife will go private again. Both are unlikely for Cramer.  That means Herbalife is nothing but a supplements company that  trades off points, and that's not enough to take the stock  dramatically higher.  ""I can't endorse this one until Herbalife can demonstrate  sustained earnings power with the changes to the business model,  and for that all we can do is wait and see,"" Cramer said.  Square shot up 8 percent on Thursday after it also reported  better-than-expected earnings. In addition to payment processing,  Square also makes loans to small and medium sized customers. And  while Cramer has always said it is hard to value a company  plagued with credit risk, some of those fears were alleviated  with the latest earnings report.  ""I heard a lot of people say this stock surged because the  company reported better than expected revenues, but I think  that's a mistake.  I believe Square's going higher because  they explained their credit exposure to merchants in a way that  made us feel like we no longer need to be concerned that Square  is some kind of wayward bank masquerading as a tech company,""  Cramer said.  That translated Square into a high-growth loss-making company in  the very competitive payments space. Cramer estimated that the  stock was worth more than it was on Wednesday, but not more than  the huge gain it had on Thursday because of the tough payment  environment.  Cramer's ultimate target for Square was its all-time high  price of $15. However, risk  has grown for small-to-medium sized retailers since it hit that  price in March.  Questions for Cramer?

"        Ackman's Pershing Square sells Canadian Pacific stake
			                 ",2016,08,03,"   William A. Ackman, the billionaire investor, is once again  shaking up his underperforming hedge fund's portfolio by selling  off a big equity stake in the railway company Canadian Pacific.  Mr. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management on Wednesday sold  its entire stake of 9.8 million shares in Canadian Pacific  Railway in a series of trades arranged by three Wall Street  banks, according to four people who asked not to be named. The  shares were valued at about $1.5 billion based on Tuesday's  closing price. Canadian Pacific shares closed on Wednesday at  $147.28.  The move comes during another rough year for the well-known  activist investor and his $11.9 billion firm.  As of the end of July, Pershing Square Holdings, a publicly  traded fund, was down 19 percent for the year. Last year, it lost  20.5 percent.More from the The New York Times:Time Warner deal gives Hulu a much-needed $580 million liftWalmart is said to be in talks to acquire Jet.comFederal Reserve fines Goldman Sachs $36 million in document leak  Mr. Ackman runs a highly concentrated portfolio that places big  bets on a small number of companies, often accompanied by the  manager's demands for corporate changes. As such, Pershing Square  is particularly vulnerable to significant declines in the prices  of just a few stocks.  The hedge fund has investments in about a dozen stocks, and it  has been selling off big stakes in several of its  better-performing positions throughout the year. The dollars  raised from the stock sales could be used by the firm to pay  redemptions to investors or to buy a big block of shares in  another company later this year. In recent weeks, Pershing Square  officials in meetings with investors have referred to the  proceeds from stock sales as ""dry powder"" that could be used for  a future stock purchase.  In a recent conference call, Mr. Ackman said investor requests to  redeem money from the firm were running below average this year  despite the firm's disappointing performance.  Earlier this year, Pershing reduced its stake in Mondelez  International, selling 20 million shares in the food and beverage  company. It also sold more than 16 million shares in Zoetis, the  former animal health arm of Pfizer.  In April, the firm sold 4.1 million of the shares it had in  Canadian Pacific, which at the time reduced its overall stake by  30 percent.  Pershing Square has suffered outsize losses on several stocks in  its portfolio — most notably Valeant Pharmaceuticals. The  troubled drug company's shares have fallen 78 percent this year  as it has come under pressure over its pricing strategies and  some of its sales distribution practices. Mr. Ackman is now a  member of Valeant's board and has told investors he intends to  take a hands-on approach to overseeing the company's turnaround.  The hedge fund's big bearish bet on Herbalife, the nutritional  food supplement, worked against it once again this year. Shares  of Herbalife are up 24 percent this year even after the company  paid a $200 million to the Federal Trade Commission to settle an  investigation into its business practices.  The settlement with the F.T.C., however, was something of a moral  victory for Mr. Ackman, who has waged a high-octane campaign  against Herbalife, claiming it is an unlawful pyramid scheme that  takes advantage of its customers — many of whom are either  poor or of modest means. The F.T.C. stopped short of calling  Herbalife a pyramid scheme and ordering it to shut down. But the  regulatory agency did charge the company with ""deceiving hundreds  of thousands of hopeful people"" and directed it to make  substantial changes to its sales practices and hire an outside  monitor to oversee its activities.  Mr. Ackman has said his firm is maintaining its ""short"" bet,  which will prove profitable if Herbalife's stock price collapses.  Mr. Ackman has said Herbalife's revenue and profit will tumble if  it changes its business practices as the F.T.C. has ordered.  Canadian Pacific has been one of Pershing Square's  better-performing investments. The firm began buying shares and  establishing a big stake in the company in 2011, when the stock  was selling for just under $50. Shares of Canadian Pacific closed  on Wednesday at $147.28.  In a May investor letter, Mr. Ackman said he continued ""to have  tremendous confidence in C.P.'s management and prospects"" despite  the earlier April sale of stock.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/03/ackmans-pershing-square-sells-canadian-pacific-stake.html

"        The activist and Herbalife: Just maybe Bill Ackman got it right
			                 ",2016,08,02,"  Bill Ackman, the  activist investor, has been painted as a loser in his yearslong  quest to shut down Herbalife, the nutritional supplement company that he  bet against, contending it defrauded customers and was a pyramid  scheme.  Two weeks ago, Herbalife paid $200 million to settle a case  brought by the Federal Trade Commission. Herbalife's stock rose  after the settlement, which showed that investors took the  development as little more than a slap on the wrist.  On Wall Street, Mr. Ackman's rivals snickered. The headlines have  been withering: ""Herbalife Settles Pyramid Scheme Case With  Regulator, in Blow to Pershing's Ackman,"" Reuters wrote.  ""Herbalife Scores Huge Victory in Its Bill Ackman Battle With  F.T.C. Settlement,"" Forbes said. And on and on. More from The New York Times:Under Pressure, Big Banks Vie for Instant Payment  MarketNick Denton Files for Bankruptcy, Just Weeks After Gawker  DidSupremeCourt Could Redefine Insider Trading Law  And yet there's something grossly wrong with this  assessment.  Whether you like or hate Mr. Ackman — my column in November  was as critical as any about some of his escapades — the  F.T.C.'s complaint is a vindication of Mr. Ackman's claims.  Yes, Mr. Ackman has lost a ton of money for his investors on his  bet against Herbalife. But with the F.T.C. settlement, he has won  a moral victory that could very well help hundreds of thousands  of Herbalife's defrauded customers, who are mainly low-income  immigrants who would most likely not have had any legal recourse  had Mr. Ackman not loudly called the company into question.  I have to admit I didn't fully appreciate the magnitude of Mr.  Ackman's accomplishment until I watched a new documentary about  his battle with Herbalife: ""Betting on Zero."" The movie premiered  at the Tribeca Film Festival in April; its title is drawn from  Mr. Ackman's prediction that the company's stock would one day be  worth nothing.  The film, directed by Theodore Braun, is remarkably poignant and  is in negotiations for a distributor; it is being screened this  Saturday in East Hampton. At the end of the movie, during the  credits, Mr. Braun shows Edith Ramirez, head of the F.T.C., at a  news conference last month announcing the settlement.  Herbalife, she said, was responsible for ""deceiving hundreds of  thousands of hopeful people."" She described ""the dream portrayed  by Herbalife"" as an illusion. She went on to say that ""the vast  majority of Herbalife distributors found they could make little  or no money selling Herbalife products.""  Worse still, Ms. Ramirez said, her agency had determined that  ""people who leased space and opened a nutrition club and worked  long hours made no money or lost money."" And, she concluded: ""The  small minority of Herbalife distributors who did make a lot of  money were paid by Herbalife not for selling the company's  products, but for buying the products themselves and then  successfully recruiting large networks of others to do the  same.""  In other words, she described pretty much exactly what Mr. Ackman  has been saying for the last three years.  According to Mr. Ackman in 2014, ""These people work really hard,  and unfortunately, they don't realize that they've been  defrauded.""  Herbalife repeatedly said that was a lie. ""These accusations are  provably false,"" Herbalife's chief financial officer, John G.  DeSimone, told The New York Times in 2014.  And here we are today, and they were true.  ""If it were not for Bill, I don't think the F.T.C. would have  launched an investigation,"" Mr. Braun, the director, said. ""Bill  is unquestionably the catalyst.""  Herbalife refused to participate in the film, though Mr. Braun  said he met and spoke privately with Herbalife's chief executive,  Michael O. Johnson, for several hours.  Ever since the film — which ends by seemingly sympathizing  with Mr. Ackman — was first screened, Herbalife has been on  a crusade against the movie. It bought the domain name ""bettingonzero.com"" so  that when the movie's title was searched in Google, people would  stumble upon a website decrying Mr. Ackman. The site questions  whether the movie was financed by Mr. Ackman — a question I  asked both Mr. Braun and Mr. Ackman. Both said it wasn't, and Mr.  Braun said he hadn't met Mr. Ackman until 2013 when he approached  him about the film.  The website also noted that the producer of ""Betting on Zero"" and  Bill Ackman were on the same crew team in college. According to  Mr. Braun, one of the producers, Devin Adair, ""overlapped"" with  Mr. Ackman at Harvard, but said that they were not friends and  hadn't talked in decades. Ms. Adair was the coxswain for one of  the crew boats; Mr. Ackman rowed on a different boat.  Mr. Braun — who previously made ""Darfur  Now,"" a documentary about genocide in the Darfur region  of Sudan that was produced by the actor Don Cheadle, among others  — said that when he first began researching the battle  between Mr. Ackman and Herbalife, he wasn't sure who was on the  right side. He said he wanted to produce a film that explored  ""the place of money in America.""  The battle has been portrayed as either a pitched fight between a  narcissistic, know-it-all investor seeking to bankrupt a company  for profit (that's Herbalife's view) or as a crusading moralist  trying to right a wrong. It may be a combination of both.  ""This is an 'Emperor Wears No Clothes' story,"" Mr. Braun said,  explaining that the charm of that fairy tale ""is it's told by the  sweet little boy."" The message, he noted, is harder to accept  when ""the messenger is a tough hedge fund manager.""  And while there have long been moral questions about the very  concept of ""shorting"" — betting against a company's stock  — it is hard not to look at this particular situation as an  example of an investor acting as a check on the market.  Admittedly, there were questions about Mr. Ackman's tactics. He  spent more than $50 million on his campaign, lobbying regulators  and members of Congress to look into Herbalife's practices. But  if Mr. Ackman didn't do it, who would? Complaints about Herbalife  have been made for years, but it wasn't until Mr. Ackman very  loudly got involved that the government stepped in.  There are those who worry that Mr. Ackman's involvement in  Herbalife means the oligarchs have taken over — that  billionaires have become de facto regulators. It is a valid  concern. And the billionaires may not always be on the right  side. (Mr. Ackman has been involved in some investments, like  Valeant Pharmaceuticals and J. C. Penney, that didn't go his  way.)  But, in this instance, he won a victory that will have real  benefits for many people.  And yet on Wall Street, his victory is considered hollow because  he has so far lost money on his bet against Herbalife.  ""Truth, candor and transparency are at odds with the measuring  stick that Wall Street applies,"" Mr. Braun said.  For now, Herbalife is heralding the settlement as a victory that  will allow it to move on with its business. But Mr. Braun says  that if the company genuinely changes its business model to  conform with the settlement, ""I can't imagine a way for them to  be profitable.""  ""I don't think this is over,"" he added.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/08/02/the-activist-and-herbalife-just-maybe-ackmans-right.html
"        Activist hedge fund Marcato takes stake in Terex
			                 ",2016,07,28,"   Just days after announcing a substantial new position in the  restaurant chain operator Buffalo Wild Wings, the hedge fund Marcato Capital  Management plans to announce a new 5.1 percent position in the  crane maker Terex,  according to someone familiar with the matter.  Shares of Terex jumped more than 4 percent to around $24 on  CNBC's televised report of the stake. Shares were very briefly  halted after the report but resumed trading almost  immediately.  That stake, which could be announced as early as Thursday  afternoon, is based on Marcato's belief that Terex is worth more  than its current price — and that selling certain parts of  its industrial business and streamlining others through  restructuring, cost savings, and other measures could improve  margins substantially, this person added.   Marcato thinks highly of Terex's current chief, John Garrison  Jr., the person said, a fact that could ease discussions between  the hedge fund and the company.  Terex has been in the news of late thanks to two cross-border  acquisition attempts, one by the Finnish competitors Konecranes and a second  by the Chinese equipment manufacturer Zoomlion, both of which ultimately fell  apart.   ""We welcome Marcato as a shareholder and appreciate their  confidence in our business and management,"" a Terex official told CNBC. ""We look forward  to listening to ideas that could help improve our company and  enhance shareholder value.""

"        Herbalife is in the cross hairs of short sellers — again
			                 ",2016,07,19,"   After a brief respite, short-sellers are piling back into  Herbalife.  In the wake of an agreement the dietary supplement firm reached  with the Federal Trade Commission, skepticism is rising over whether Herbalife is out of the woods. Traders had been covering their short bets ahead of the ruling released Friday, but are re-establishing  their positions, according to financial analytics firm S3 Partners.  ""There was apprehension in the shorts, and they were actually  closing down their positions in anticipation of the FTC report,""  said Ihor Dusaniwsky, S3's head of research. ""Once that  happened, they actually read it and understood what [the report]  said, they bounced back.""  Initial reports ahead of the official release were that the FTC  had cleared Herbalife of being a pyramid. In fact, the report  never made that specific distinction, and commission officials  sharply criticized the company's business practices.  Herbalife has been in the news thanks largely to a high-profile  war that hedge fund manager Bill Ackman has waged against the  company. With a billion-dollar short in play, Ackman has  contended that the company is engaged in a pyramid scheme where  its representatives benefit more from recruiting new distributors  than from actual sales. In a statement Friday after the ruling, Ackman said that ""while  it appears that Herbalife negotiated away the words 'pyramid  scheme' from the settlement agreement, the FTC's findings are  clear.""  Ackman declined Tuesday through a spokesman to comment further.  Herbalife officials did not immediately respond to a request for  comment.  Shares have risen consistently since early 2015, notching a gain  of nearly 20 percent in 2016. The stock saw a rapid spike Friday  after the FTC report, but has cooled since and was down more than  1 percent Tuesday afternoon. And the shorts have lingered.  Herbalife over the past three years:    Since the FTC decision came down, about $125 million in new  shorts have come in, including $70 million into the close Friday,  according to S3. The dollar level of shorts is nearing $1.6  billion, which Dusaniwsky said is the highest level since  July 2014, a year during which Herbalife shares lost about half  their value. That has happened even though the cost to borrow  shares for shorting is about double for Herbalife — at  close to 1 percent annually — than typical.  In fact, he said there soon may be a scarcity of shares for  lending to short sellers, though there still remain a few million  available. Short sellers borrow stock for a fee, then sell  and agree to repurchase at a later date in hopes of pocketing a  profit after shares fall.  ""Next week is going to be important,"" Dusaniwsky said. ""If  this continues on rates are going to get more expensive to put  your shorts on. We're going to start running out of stock to  borrow.""  Icahn Capital, headed by Ackman's fellow billionaire hedge  manager and sometime-nemesis Carl Icahn, is Herbalife's biggest  holder with 17 million shares, or about 18.3 percent of the total  available, according to S&P Capital IQ. His shares had a  market value of nearly $1.1 billion as of Tuesday trading.

"        The world’s biggest hedge fund, Bridgewater, is said to be slowing hiring
			                 ",2016,07,18,"   After years of rapid internal growth, the world's biggest hedge  fund appears to be slowing down.  The $154 billion hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, run by the  billionaire Ray  Dalio, is known for hiring hundreds of people every year. Yet  it is now telling recruitment firms to cancel interviews with  prospective employees, according to three people briefed on the  matter.  In recent weeks, dozens of interviews were canceled and advanced  negotiations with prospective employees were cut short by the  firm, those people said. More from The New York  Times:WhenYahoo Ruled the Valley:  Stories of the Original 'Surfers' TheTop 20 Venture Capital  Investors Worldwide ABank Too Big to Jail  And some of the firm's external recruiters have been told  Bridgewater will not use them for the time being, said the  people, who were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.  Bridgewater emphasizes secrecy in its communication with  investors and the external recruiting firms, and the people  requested anonymity because they did not want their relationship  with the firm to be affected.  It was unclear whether the suspension of recruiting in some areas  was temporary or a reflection of a new push to gradually shrink  the size of the firm. At the moment, there does not appear to be  any talk of layoffs. The firm employs 1,500 people, most of them  at its sprawling headquarters in Westport, Conn.Still, the signs of a pullback in recruiting at Bridgewater are  emerging at a time when a number of hedge funds, struggling with  poor performance and unhappy investors, are starting to cut back.  For example, William A. Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square  Capital Management, whose main fund is down 19.1 percent this  year, recently fired a dozen employees.  The average hedge fund is up 1.6 percent this year through the  end of June, according to the Hedge Fund Research Composite  Index, the broadest gauge of hedge fund performance. By contrast,  the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up 5.76  percent.  Bridgewater is not immune to the industry's pressures. It has had  uneven performance in its two main portfolio funds, and at least  one prominent investor has pulled out a significant sum of money  over the last year.  The firm's flagship Pure Alpha fund, which makes broad bets on  global economic trends, is down 8.8 percent, while its All  Weather fund, which the firm contends will ""perform well across  all environments,"" is up 10.4 percent.  But last year, those performances were reversed: The All Weather  fund lost investors 6.9 percent, while Pure Alpha gained 4.7  percent.  Over the last two years, the University of California's Board of  Regents, the endowment for the state university system in  California, has withdrawn the $550 million it had invested with  Bridgewater.  Jagdeep Singh Bachher, the chief investment officer for the  University of California regents, said in an interview that  Bridgewater made money for the endowment, but that a decision was  made to focus on investment strategies that would do best. He  also said there were some concerns about the future direction of  Bridgewater's leadership.  It has been a tumultuous year for the firm. Bridgewater publicly  prides itself on what it calls ""radical transparency"" in its  dealing with employees, but is very private about discussing its  operations. The firm is in the process of reorganizing its core  management committee that reports directly to Mr. Dalio, who  founded Bridgewater in 1975.  This year, Greg Jensen, a co-chief investment officer who was  seen as the heir apparent, was removed from his role as co-chief  executive after reports of a schism between him and Mr. Dalio.  Bridgewater hired Jon Rubinstein, a former Apple executive who  had worked closely with Steven P. Jobs, to replace Mr. Jensen.  Bridgewater has publicly denied there were any internal rifts.  The firm is known for its unusual culture, where employees are  encouraged to question and sometimes admonish one another. Mr.  Dalio encourages all employees to read ""Principles,"" a little  white book that each is given and that includes 210 motivational  tips like, ""Don't worry about looking good — worry about  achieving your goals.""  Publicly, the firm attributed the management shake-up to the need  to ""strike the right balance"" for Mr. Jensen, who Bridgewater  said was balancing too much as both co-chief executive and  co-chief investment officer.  Mr. Dalio, who is 66, has created a core committee of managers  that share top executive positions as part of a transition plan  for when he retires. The firm has communicated to investors that  the arrangement is part of a ""planful transition from a  founder-led boutique to a professionally managed  institution.""  Nevertheless, it has worried some investors.""The management transition, in my view, it just didn't feel  smooth,"" Mr. Bachher, of the University of California regents,  said.Despite the management transition and the apparent slowdown in  hiring, Bridgewater continues to plan to expand its headquarters.Connecticut has given Bridgewater $22 million in financial aid in  an effort to keep the firm from moving its headquarters out of  the state. The money is expected to go toward the expansion of  Bridgewater's complex in Westport as well as its facilities in  Wilton and Norwalk, according to the State Bond Commission.Bridgewater recently received tentative approval from Westport  town officials for its expansion plan, according to public  documents filed in Westport's town hall. The plans would include  the construction of an underground parking garage and another  building at the Bridgewater campus at 1 Glendinning Place, the  firm's headquarters tucked away in the woods and surrounded by  streams.It is accessible only by a nondescript road.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/18/bridgewater-worlds-biggest-hedge-fund-is-said-to-be-slowing-hiring.html

"        Herbalife soars after dodging pyramid scheme tag in FTC settlement
			                 ",2016,07,15,"   The Federal Trade Commission settled with Herbalife on Friday, effectively determining that the nutritional supplement marketer is not a pyramid scheme.  Separately, the company said Carl  Icahn and his interests have retained the right to boost  their ownership stake of Herbalife to 34.99 percent, up from a  previous maximum of 25 percent.  Icahn currently owns 17 million common shares, or about 18  percent of Herbalife's outstanding common shares.The FTC skirted the phrase ""pyramid scheme"" or ""Ponzi"" in its pronouncement, but by calling for changes to Herbalife's operations, rather than shutting the company down altogether, critics' main charges against Herbalife were largely quashed. However, the FTC did warn Herbalife that it will need to prove that its business model is legitimate going forward.  Investors cheered the news, sending shares up 15 percent in morning trading. (Get the latest quote here.)  Noting that he believes in the company's ""strong fundamentals,"" Icahn  said, ""I have the greatest confidence in Herbalife's  CEO, Michael Johnson, and the entire management team, who have  skillfully led the Company through adversity, including holding  firm against a high-profile PR campaign against the Company by  Bill Ackman where it was alleged more than once that the Company  would be shut down. Obviously, we are still here.""  On Thursday, Ackman told CNBC he's  still betting against Herbalife, and argued that the  company needs to makes ""material changes to its incentive  structure.""The hedge fund manager has long called Herbalife a pyramid scheme.  Ackman took a short position on the company more than three years  ago. In May, he told CNBC that his bet against the company is roughly $1 billion. He  also advised Herbalife employees to leave the company because  it's ""not going to be a good thing on your resume"" and to ""go  find another job.""

Simply stated the shorts  have been completely wrong on Herbalife."" Now that the settlement  is done, Icahn said Herbalife will consider ""a range of strategic  opportunities, including potential roll-ups involving  competitors, as well as other strategic transactions.""  Under the settlement with regulators, Herbalife will pay $200  million over claims of misrepresentation. That payment stems from  claims of misrepresentation, according to Dow Jones, which  reported news of the settlement earlier. Herbalife also agreed to  change some of its business practices and will have to prove its  retail sales numbers are accurate.  Product distributors will now be paid based on actual retail  sales rather just buying the product for their own personal  consumption, according to the company statement. Distributors  will need to provide actual receipts of retail sales in order to  be paid. Herbalife will rely on a mobile app to help track sales  and distribution more closely.    — CNBC's Christine Wang contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/07/15/ftc-determines-herbalife-is-not-a-pyramid-scheme-dj.html

			                 ",2016,07,14,"  Valeant  Pharmaceuticals has no plans to sell core assets like  Bausch & Lomb, according to board member Bill Ackman.   He told CNBC's ""Halftime Report"" on Thursday that while it's likely there  will come a day where the pharmaceutical company sells a lot of  its non-core assets, Bausch & Lomb will not be one.  In fact, Ackman says it's possible that in the future, the brand  could become ""an even more dominant part of the franchise."" He said Valeant may someday even rename itself Bausch & Lomb.  ""Bausch & Lomb has a very low tax basis relative to what we  believe it is worth. We think it's a great franchise. We think  it's a franchise that you build on and it's really the core of  the company,"" he said.  Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital Management, has had a tough year, hit in  particular by its stake in Valeant. Earlier this year, Ackman  said that ""of  course"" he regrets his initial investment in the  embattled pharmaceutical company.  CNBC reported Wednesday that J. Michael Pearson, former CEO of  Valeant Pharmaceuticals, unloaded more of his personal holdings  than originally thought. The founder and CEO of Pershing Square said that ""it's kind of sad  that he was forced to sell out at this price.""U.S.-listed shares of Valeant traded near $22.40 on Thursday, a fraction of its all-time intraday high of $263.81.  According to documents not made public yet but obtained by CNBC,  Pearson sold nearly 5 million shares and options for a total of  $96.8 million. The news came on the same day that the Sequoia Fund  revealed it is completely out of the stock.  Sequoia was at one time the largest Valeant shareholder.  Also Wednesday, short seller Andrew Left said that Valeant's stock could be headed to zero, sinking share prices.  The Canadian drugmaker came under fire when The New York  Times reported that Valeant and other pharmaceutical  companies were using a network of specialty pharmacies to sustain  sales of their high-priced drugs and prevent patients and  insurers from switching to cheaper generic drugs. Citron Research  subsequently published a note calling Valeant the ""pharmaceutical  Enron.""  In response, Valeant formed an ad hoc committee to review the  allegations regarding specialty pharmacy Philidor RX Services.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating  the relationship between the two companies.  Ackman also said that he's still betting against Herbalife and that the  company needs to makes ""material changes to its incentive  structure.""  Recently, a number of videos highlighting that ""false and  misleading claims"" made by the nutritional supplement  marketer have been published on ""Facts About Herbalife,"" a website maintained by  Pershing Square.  When CNBC asked about why the firm is releasing so many videos  about the company, Ackman joked that Pershing Square is  ""diversifying and going into the movie production business."" The  hedge fund manager said that regardless of the result, the FTC  probe of Herbalife is unlikely to end well for the company  because it's business model isn't built upon actual retail sales.  Ackman has long called Herbalife a ""pyramid scheme.""  Ackman took a short position on the company more than three years  ago.

"        For one start-up founder, a mission to be the Bill Ackman of sneakers
			                 ",2016,05,20,"   Christopher Hall, who recognizes a good market opportunity when  he sees one, wants to be to sneaker lovers what Bill Ackman is to  shareholders.  The 22-year-old has a start-up, Kickster, a mobile and desktop  platform designed to keep users on top of all the latest sneaker  release dates and sneaker news – in other words, a  sneakerhead's paradise – but that's not all.   Barely a year old, the company is currently developing  partnerships with boutique stores, designers and even shoe  companies. As Hall says, Kickster wants to be a consumer's  ""complete beginning-to-end service for buying shoes…  everything from knowing a shoe exists, to getting it to your  door.""   It's a daunting task, but there's little doubt the U.S. shoe  market is a goldmine. Shoe enthusiasts and the athletically  inclined are willing to pay top dollar – which can run to   thousands of dollars in the resale market – to own some of the  flashiest brands like Nike's blockbuster Air Jordan's.  SportsOneSource estimates that U.S. sneaker sales topped $23  billion last year, and has grown by more than 30 percent since  2004.  The upstart Kickster ""harnesses the insatiable community behind  the high-end sneaker and fashion market to bring more value to  everyone,"" Hall told CNBC in a recent interview.   ""These markets are desperately underserved and pathetically  underrated, and Kickster is solving their most fundamental and  complex problems by putting the community first, and backing it  up with the best technical systems on the planet,"" Hall said  Kickster began as iSwapp, an app that ultimately  was never released to the public but was originally envisioned as  a user-to-user marketplace for the vast secondary sneaker sales  market. Yet it wasn't until a fateful meeting with an Instagram  employee that the company's leadership team decided to reorient  its focus.  ""We had firsthand experience with people buying and selling  shoes, and it became clear that this was a great market to start  with,"" Hall told CNBC. ""People are so super-passionate about it.  They can make a lot of money, there's a lot of volume, and it's  very culturally integrated. It's an enormous part of pop culture,  in hip-hop, sports"" and fashion,"" he said.   In the vast ecosystem of Apple operating software applications,  Kickster cracked the top 300 in sports apps, and was downloaded at least 30,000 times in the first 24 hours of its release back in September. It is one of  the iOS App Store's top 30 sports applications and has been downloaded at least 150,000 times, Hall said.  Hall has a near evangelistic way of speaking about Kickster's  mission, which can be useful since it can be tough to find  converts. Recently, he and his co-founders competed to land a  spot in New York University's coveted startup incubator, but  didn't make it.   That, however, won't stop a young entrepreneur who idolizes Bill  Ackman, the billionaire activist and hedge fund manager of  Pershing Square Capital Management.   ""I was watching these interviews with him, and basically learning  how he was able to generate so much money and value for his  shareholders, simply by looking at the assets of a company and  restructuring them,"" Hall said.   And like Ackman who demands more shareholder value for the  companies in which he invests, Hall wants more for his startup.  Kickster already offers a feature that aggregates sneaker news  from some of the largest outlets who cover the scene, but is now  starting to author its own original content.   For the impatient souls who don't want to wait in line for those  new Jordans, Kickster can do it for a nominal fee. The company  also plans to develop artificial intelligence into its interface,  which will determine a user's favorite brand, colors and shoe  size, the better to expedite orders.  As much as Kickster aims to represent the sneaker culture, there  are reminders that it's still just an upstart – and an  underfunded one at that. Nobody on the 12-person team is  compensated yet, and Kickster's still trying to work out a  revenue model that fits.  In that vein, much of what Kickster intends to do comes down to  receiving funding or relies purely on only promised ideas. But  like many other starry-eyed entrepreneurs, Kickster has a vision  and for its leader, that might be just enough.   ""We had barely put any effort into this, and it's already doing  pretty well,"" Hall said. ""Imagine if we put in some work… we  could make something really cool, and definitely much more  useful."" Correction: This story was revised to correct that Kickster has received more than 150,000 since its inception.

"        Icahn, Ackman, Loeb, other heavyweights form new lobbying arm
			                 ",2016,05,19,"   A group of hedge funds have formed a new lobbying arm to promote  the benefits of shareholder activism across the U.S. economy, as  U.S. politicians turn up the heat on activist investors.The Council for Investor Rights and Corporate Accountability  (CIRCA) announced its formation on Wednesday, saying it is  committed to promoting the actions of shareholder activists, and  their positive impact on corporate governance and business  policies at publicly traded companies.The Washington D.C.-based trade association said it is backed by  a consortium of activist firms, but does not name them in the  press release. According to a person with direct knowledge of the  matter, the group's backers are: William Ackman of Pershing  Square, Carl Icahn, Daniel Loeb of Third Point, Paul Singer of  Elliott Associates and Barry Rosenstein of Jana Partners.  Activist investors buy minority stakes in what they believe are  under-valued and poorly managed companies and then quickly  agitate for changes. Activists often push for overhauls in  corporate strategy, cash management, management team and board  composition — sometimes under the threat of a proxy  fight if the company does not meet their demands.  Activist investors launched a record 508 campaigns against U.S.  companies last year, according to Thomson Reuters data, targeting  names such as DuPont, General Electric, and AIG.  The actions of certain activist hedge funds, however, has also  attracted the attention of politicians, including Democratic  presidential candidates Hilary Clinton and Bernie Sanders.  Ackman was one of the Valeant Pharmaceuticals officials  who recently appeared in front of a congressional committee to  address the massive price hikes Valeant issued on some of its  drugs.  Valeant, a drug company whose creation was led by activist hedge  fund ValueAct Partners, is under federal investigation for its  use of specialty pharmacy companies.  Politicians have targeted activists for being short term  investors, at the expense of longer term shareholders.  ""CIRCA was founded on the widely accepted idea that a  well-functioning system of checks and balances between boards of  directors and shareholders is fundamental to long term economic  growth and U.S. prosperity,"" CIRCA Senior Advisor Rob  Collins said in the press release.  The page and a half announcement does not detail specific actions  the group plans to takes, but rather outlines its core  principles, which include effective engagement between boards and  investors and ensuring that regulations to not allow board  entrenchment.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/19/activist-investor-heavyweights-form-new-lobbying-arm.html
"        Cramer: The one niche group immune to market volatility
			                 ",2016,05,17,"   Retail, technology, biotech and the financials were all taken  down by the bear this week. But Jim Cramer found the one group  that has quietly managed to defy any weakness in the averages,  even on Tuesday when the market was hit hard.  Americans have spent fortunes to keep their pets happy and  healthy. So, it makes sense that even if the economy wavers, the  pet care group would continue to roar. Cramer decided to take a  look at the charts to see what could be in store for Petmed  Express, Blue Buffalo Pet Products, Vet Centers of America, Freshpet, Zoetis and IDEXX Laboratories.  ""Sometimes the best ideas are staring you right in the face,"" the  ""Mad Money"" host said.  Cramer turned to the wisdom of Bob Lang to interpret the charts.  Lang is a technician and founder of ExplosiveOptions.net and a  colleague of Cramer's at RealMoney.com.  Petmed Express is America's largest pet-centric pharmacy. It  recently broke out to the upside on strong volume and has been  consolidating. Lang expects the stock to move sharply higher, as  the volume indicated that this move is the real deal.  Buffalo Blue is the high end maker of pet food. It had the  misfortune of coming public last summer before the marketwide  sell-off. However, Blue Buffalo seems to have found its footing, and the stock jumped higher. Lang saw signs that big  institutional money managers have been buying this stock and  anticipated that it could head back to its all-time high of $29  and beyond.

It has been rallying  in a straight line since February, and he considered it a great  buy on a pullback to its 20-day moving average.  Freshpet is the maker of high-end pet food that is refrigerated.  It has struggled since it came public in 2014, but Cramer noted  an improvement since February. The Chaikin Money flow oscillator  was positive for FreshPet, along with solid volume trends and an  improved chart. Lang said it could be worth buying for  speculation down 50 cents from its current price.IDEXX Laboratories is a veterinary diagnostics play. Its daily chart showed an improving range since February. The Chaikin Money flow also continued to be strong, meaning there is money flowing into the stock. Lang also noted its relative strength, and Cramer was impressed with the fundamentals.  Finally, there was Zoetis, the animal health company spun off by Pfizer. The stock exploded in March and April, and  Lang said the recent pullback is simply a consolidation to digest  the enormous gains.   ""We learned that noted hedge fund manager Bill Ackman reduced his  stake in Zoetis last week, and while the stock got hit on the  news, I wouldn't read too much into it,"" Cramer said.  So, in a market where it is hard to find winners, pet care stocks  have proven to be consistently strong. Cramer's top picks are IDEXX  and Zoetis; he thinks they could work in the current  environment.  Questions for Cramer?  Call Cramer: 1-800-743-CNBC  Want to take a deep dive into Cramer's world?

			                 ",2016,05,12,"  Bill Ackman is  parting company with the man who introduced him to his disastrous  investment in Valeant  Pharmaceuticals.  Bill Doyle is leaving Mr Ackman's hedge fund, Pershing Square,  after less than two years, as the fund tries to claw its way back  from losses on Valeant shares, according to its latest letter to  investors.  Mr Doyle is a former Harvard classmate of Mr Ackman and  introduced him to Michael Pearson, the chief executive who was  building Valeant into a pharmaceuticals giant using an innovative  business model combining debt-funded acquisitions and raising  drug prices.  Mr Doyle and Mr Pearson had been colleagues at McKinsey, the  consulting firm, and the pair helped persuade Mr Ackman to fund  an audacious takeover bid by Valeant for Allergan. ""Bill vouched  for Mike,"" Mr Ackman said of Mr Doyle after that ultimately  doomed bid was announced in 2014. ""There was a lot of trust  there.""  In Pershing Square's letter to investors on Wednesday, Mr Ackman  said that Mr Doyle would be leaving to concentrate on his role as  executive chairman of a brain cancer company Novocure.  ""The demands of overseeing Novocure and managing its relationship  with its shareholders and other stakeholders have made it  infeasible for Bill to continue as a member of the investment  team,"" Mr Ackman wrote, although he added that he was not  severing ties with Mr Doyle completely.""In addition to Novocure,  he will be working part-time at Table Management, an entity which  oversees private investments for my family,"" Mr Ackman  wrote.  Mr Doyle, who has also been an executive at Johnson & Johnson  and a venture capital investor in healthcare, joined Pershing  Square's investment team full-time in 2014, after a year as a  consultant. His departure was announced at the end of a letter in  which Mr Ackman put a bullish spin on Valeant's prospects.  The company's plunging share price contributed 16 percentage  points of Pershing Square's 26 per cent loss in the first quarter  of 2016.

The report  restated two quarters of revenue numbers related to a pharmacy  chain controlled by the company, and disclosed several new  investigations into its accounting practices. However, its  publication came in time to prevent default on Valeant's $30bn of  debt.

Spotted in the crowd was Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, Invemed chief  and Home  Depot co-founder Ken Langone, KKR co-founder Henry Kravis, Bob Pittman  and John Sykes of iHeart Media. Hedge fund managers Ken Griffin,  Dan Och,  Larry Robbins, Howard Marks and David Einhorn and venture  philanthropist Peter Kiernan were also in  attendance.  Restaurateur and Union Square Events head, Danny Meyer,  of Shake  Shack fame, created the three course meal for over four  thousand people.   ""The space here at the Javits Convention Center is so vast, and  the crowd so varied and high-profile, that it's a thrill be part  of this great cause,"" Meyer told CNBC. He added that his  fourth consecutive time catering the Robin Hood gala was like his  ""own personal Super Bowl."" Entertainment for the event was provided by Usher, the Zac Brown Band and  comedian Jim Gaffigain. Also in attendance was Pershing Square Capital Founder Bill Ackman, BlackRock chairman and CEO Laurence  Fink and  legendary investor Paul Tudor Jones—who at one point took to the stage  wearing a large hat in the shape of the human brain.

Separately,  Allergan reported adjusted quarterly profit of $3.04 per share,  beating estimates by 3 cents a share. Lumber  Liquidators — The flooring maker lost an  adjusted 35 cents per share for its latest quarter, 11 cents a share wider than expected. Revenue was below forecasts, as well. Lumber Liquidators saw same-store sales fall 13.9 percent  compared to a year earlier. Gap  Inc. — The apparel retailer posted lower-than-expected quarterly sales and also issued an earnings warning. Gap  has been hurt by weak demand at both the Banana Republic and Old  Navy chains. Dean  Foods — The company is buying the  manufacturing and retail ice cream business of Friendly's Ice  Cream for $155 million in cash. Separately, Dean beat estimates  by 7 cents a share, with adjusted quarterly profit of 45 cents per share. However, revenue was very slightly below forecasts.   Norwegian Cruise  Line — The cruise ship operator matched  estimates with adjusted quarterly profit of 38 cents per share.  Revenue was below Street forecasts, however, due in large part to  softness in the European market. Hasbro — The toymaker's stock was  downgraded to ""neutral"" from ""overweight"" at Piper Jaffray, which  said the stock is fairly priced heading into a time of year that  is traditionally off season for the toy industry. Stamps.com — The internet postage service  earned an adjusted $1.72 per share for its latest quarter, far  above estimates of $1.06 a share. The company also raised its  full-year outlook, as it continues to successfully  integrate recent acquisitions. SolarCity — SolarCity posted an adjusted  loss of $2.56 per share, wider than the $2.32 a share expected by  analysts. The solar company's revenue did beat Street forecasts,  but the company also cut its forecast for solar panel  installations for 2016. LendingClub — The online lender remains in  the news, following yesterday's ouster of CEO Renaud Laplanche.  The Wall Street Journal reports that board member and  former Morgan  Stanley CEO John Mack joined Laplanche is investing in  an outside fund in which the company was also considering an  investment. United  Continental — United reported a 1.9 percent  drop in revenue passenger miles for April compared to a year  earlier. The airline maintained its prior forecast for a  6.5 percent to 8.5 percent decline for the second quarter,  pointing to a stronger dollar, travel reductions from oil  industry customers, and other factors. Rackspace — Rackspace reported quarterly  profit of 37 cents per share, 15 cents a share above estimates. Revenue was essentially in line with expectations. The cloud computing company,  however, gave a lower-than-expected revenue outlook for the  current quarter. Rackspace is in the midst of a transition to an  emphasis on services. Hertz  Global — Hertz lost 12 cents per share for its  latest quarter, 11 cents a share wider than expected. The car  rental giant's revenue also fell below forecasts. Hertz has been  impacted by a worldwide decline in rental prices, but it  continues to back its prior 2016 forecast as it cuts costs. Zoetis — Zoetis is on the watch list  following a New York Times report that investor Bill  Ackman's Pershing Square is cutting its stake in the animal  vaccine maker. Pershing is said to be selling 16.85 million  shares, which would cut its stake to 25 million shares. Nokia — Nokia reported lower-than-expected sales of telecom equipment for its first quarter, and it  also said its full-year earnings would fall as demand for mobile  equipment weakens in key markets. This marks the first earnings  report for Nokia since it took control of Alcatel-Lucent in  January. Baidu — Baidu was ordered by China  regulators to change its advertising practices. That follows an  investigation into the death of a college student who had cancer  and had taken a therapy found through a Baidu ad.

			                 ",2016,05,10,"  William A. Ackman,  the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Pershing Square Capital  Management, is paring back a stake in a health care stock. But it  is not the one that has been generating lots of negative  headlines.  On Monday, Pershing set out to sell 16.85 million shares in  Zoetis, the former  animal health arm of Pfizer, for a price range of $46.75 to $47 per share,  according to two people with direct knowledge of the deal who  requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak  publicly.  The transaction is expected to be valued around $800 million and  will be managed by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Credit  Suisse. Pershing will continue to own 25 million shares in the  company.

The fund has concentrated positions in a dozen  companies, making the portfolio vulnerable to sharp declines in  just one or two holdings. Mr. Ackman may be selling the shares to  raise cash in response to investor redemption requests or in  order to make a new investment.  Pershing Square trimmed its stake in another holding in March,  selling 20 million shares in Mondelez International, the food and  beverage company.

He told CNBC on Monday ""if you find yourself as an Herbalife  employee today, my advice is that you should leave the company  because this is not going to be a good thing on your resume. I'd  go find another job.""

"        Sarepta investor: High drug prices are good
			                 ",2016,05,05,"   If you can't charge ""hundreds of thousands"" of dollars a year for  drugs, there will be no drugs for orphan diseases, Joe Edelman,  Perceptive Advisors CEO, told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime Report.""   ""I think high drug prices are actually good,"" Edelman said  Thursday. ""And the reason they're good is, let's say you have a  disease. I'll use an example of Alzheimer's. Very risky to develop a drug. You  want the reward to be great. ... You're not going to spend  a billion dollars and take all these risks to charge the typical  $10,000 a year on a drug.""   Edelman's firm manages $1.3 billion in assets and was the best  performing hedge fund last year, seeing a return of more than 51  percent.   Edelman is optimistic on the sector at a time when its major  players are facing unprecedented pressure. Shares of IBB, a fund  that tracks the biotech sector, are down more than 23 percent so  far this year, coming off its worst quarterly  performance since 2002 as presidential candidates  from both sides  have bashed the industry's high prices.   ""I think people generally know that whoever's the president,  they're not going to destroy the [sector]. ... It hasn't impacted  the drug stocks that much,"" Edelman said.   Still, Edelman says he's staying away  from  Valeant  Pharmaceuticals, and doesn't know it well enough to be buying  it. Valeant has gotten regulatory scrutiny for its pricing  practices, and has now considered rolling them back, according to  activist investor Bill Ackman.   ""Valeant does not, in fact, invest that much in R&D, so if  you wanted to make an exception, unfortunately it would have to  be Valeant,"" Edelman said.   Still, Edelman sees at least one bright opportunity in another  battered biotech name: Sarepta. His firm is the fifth largest  shareholder of Sarepta.  The stock is down more than 56 percent so far this year as the  approval of its flagship treatment is hotly debated among  regulators. Analysts at JMP Securities model just a 10 percent  chance of approval for the drug and estimate that the company  will run out of cash by the end of the year if the drug does not  get first pass approval. Three analysts downgraded the company to ""sell"" Thursday,  including JMP.    Edelman remains bullish on Sarepta Therapeutics and believes its Duchenne  muscular dystrophy drug, eteplirsen, will be approved. Although  the Food and Drug  Administration reviewers took a negative stance on the  drug, the people above the reviewers have the power to overrule  them and approve the drug.  ""I think it's extremely likely, as a matter of fact, to get  approved,"" Edelman said. ""It easily meets the standard of  accelerated approval. ... It's not certain that the drug works,  but it's certain that it's reasonably likely that it's  working.""  Disclosure: Sarepta is among the top holdings in Perceptive  Advisors' funds. — Reuters and CNBC's Christine Wang and Bree Kelly contributed to this  report.

"        Hedge funds are finding out that flat is the new up this year
			                 ",2016,05,03,"   Beset by market volatility, crowded into similar strategies and  in many cases bogged down by huge piles of investment capital,  hedge funds are struggling this year, paving the way for poor  results.  ""It's hard to maximize returns and also maximize assets,""  Steve Cohen, the  well-known former hedge fund manager who now runs Point 72, a  multibillion dollar family office, said during a panel  discussion Monday at the Milken Institute Global Conference.  Cohen's own fund fell 8 percent during a four-day period in  February, then spent the ensuing months clawing its way back to  zero — which is where it ended April, according to someone  familiar with the matter.   ""The business got crowded,"" Cohen added on Monday night's panel.  ""The strategies aren't that differentiated."" (Someone familiar  with the matter said that Cohen's fund got caught being long  momentum stocks during a return to value. A firm spokesman  declined, via e-mail, to provide the details of what went wrong.)  As a fund company challenged to eke out returns at the moment,  Cohen isn't alone. Third Point Offshore, the flagship fund run by the  event-driven manager Dan Loeb, gained nearly two points in  April, only to finish the month down a fraction of a percent year  to date. Loeb wrote in a recent investor letter that the market  environment so far this year has been ""catastrophic"" and that  Third Point itself had wrongly predicted a weakening Chinese yuan  and then missed a rally in cyclical U.S. stocks. He shares  Cohen's sense of pessimism.  Cohen and Loeb's performances typify what's happening to large  hedge fund managers right now, including brand names, say rivals  and industry observers. ""I'd be surprised if you find a lot of  hedge funds up over 1 percent this month,"" said another stock  fund manager in an interview last week.  Although monthly hedge fund composite numbers for April aren't  yet available, the average fund was down 0.8 percent through  March, according to the data vendor HFR, and April is widely  expected not to be much better overall. Some managers, like the  activist long-short manager Bill Ackman, whose Pershing Square  Capital has fallen 18 percent so far this year, are down by even  more.  Investors are taking note. During the first quarter of the year,  they pulled more than $15 billion out of hedge funds in  aggregate, the biggest move of its kind since 2009, according to  HFR figures.   The New York City Employees Retirement System, a pension fund for  city workers, recently voted to pull some $1.5 billion worth of  hedge fund investments, citing lack of returns. And money  managers from Steve Cohen to Christopher Ailman, the California  State Teachers' Retirement System chief investment officer, who  invests money in select hedge funds, say that the traditional fee  structure of 2 percent of assets for expenses and a 20 percent  cut of any upside returns is coming under fire.   ""Two and twenty is dead,"" Ailman said in a television interview  Monday. ""People have to understand that. That model has been  broken."" Calstrs, he added, pays less than 2-and-20 to its hedge  funds.  If the lackluster performances continue, industry  observers say, more money will be pulled and funds will be  shuttered.  ""The industry has too many hedge funds,"" says Don Steinbrugge,  managing partner of Agecroft Partners, a marketing and consulting  firm for hedge funds in Richmond, Virginia. ""A lot of the  mistakes institutional investors are making [are], they're  investing in brand."" In that sense, Steinbrugge argues, the  bigger and more successful a hedge fund gets, the more elusive  returns can become.

""If you find yourself as an Herbalife employee today, my advice  is that you should leave the company because this is not going to  be a good thing on your resume. I'd go find another job,"" the  Pershing Square Capital Management CEO said on  CNBC's ""Fast  Money: Halftime Report.""   Ackman took his short position in Herbalife more than three years ago, and he said Monday his bet against the company is roughly $1 billion. He has publicly crusaded against Herbalife, repeatedly calling it a pyramid scheme and saying its business model harms people. His actions have not prevented Herbalife shares from climbing. The stock has risen more than 40 percent in the last year.  Herbalife said in a response to the hedge fund manager's overall criticism that its business has ""not only  survived, but has thrived"" amid Ackman's attacks.   ""After spending hundreds of millions of dollars and having a  negative return on his investment, maybe it is just time for Bill  to move on,"" the company said.   Ackman, though, believes the company faces more difficulties  ahead. He contended Herbalife's business ""has deteriorated  dramatically.""   In February, Herbalife said adjusted earnings for 2015's fourth  quarter came in at $1.19 per share, compared with $1.41 per share  in the year-earlier period. It also said it expects adjusted 2016 EPS  of $4.05 to $4.50 per diluted share from a previous range of  $4.35 to $4.75 per share due to foreign exchange rates.   Ackman argued that the company, which relies on distributors,  harms undocumented immigrants trying to make a living in the  United States.   A documentary called ""Betting on Zero,"" which chronicles Ackman's  campaign against Herbalife, debuted earlier this year.

			                 ",2016,05,02," Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman on Monday defended his key holding, Valeant  Pharmaceuticals, as its shares continued to  tumble and two legendary investors took swipes at its business model.   The Pershing Square Capital Management CEO responded to  Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger. Munger, Berkshire's vice chairman, on  Saturday called the drugmaker a ""sewer.""

Its shares have plunged  about 70 percent this year, hitting Ackman, who owned about 9  percent of outstanding shares as of March 24.

Ackman said he had ""a lot of respect"" for Buffett, but disagreed  with his assessment of Valeant.   Ackman contended the drugmaker has made ""appropriate changes in  personnel."" During a Senate hearing last week on Valeant's drug  pricing, Ackman said his first priority was to make sure the  company did not go bankrupt.   The company took a step toward that goal when it filed a delayed  annual report on Friday.   Ackman also addressed Coca-Cola, the soft drink maker that major shareholder Berkshire Hathaway has vigorously defended.  Ackman previously bashed the company for what he called marketing  unhealthy products to children, and Munger responded to him and  other critics Saturday.

He told CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime  Report"" he thought seriously about selling his stake in  the drugmaker, but decided he could ""fix it."" Ackman's holdings have endured a dismal year, hit in particular by the stake in Valeant.   His Pershing Square Capital Management portfolio had a return of  -17.5 percent this year as of April 26.  Valeant shares had lost about 9 percent Monday but cut the losses in half as Ackman spoke. He touted changes in the company's  structure and leadership, like its new CEO Joseph  Papa.   Ackman said he aims to create a ""meaningful"" turnaround for the  company. He added he believes Valeant has ""made appropriate  changes in personnel.""  Ackman noted that Valeant is not considering selling any ""core""  assets, despite interest from buyers.   The drugmaker on Friday filed its long-delayed annual report, helping it prevent a default on its $30 billion in debt.  It pointed out misstatements that would cut some of its  previously reported sales.   During a Senate hearing last week on Valeant's drug pricing,  Ackman said his first priority was to make sure the company did  not go bankrupt. Many politicians have recently looked to take more action on  reining in increases in the price of drugs that aren't widely available.

"        Hedge funder David Einhorn scores with fracking bet
			                 ",2016,04,28,"   Hedge fund manager David Einhorn took a bruising in the markets  last year, but at least one of his apparent strategies is now  paying off handsomely: being short a basket of U.S. oil  drillers. At the annual Sohn Investment Conference in New York last May,  Einhorn made a detailed case for selling, or going short, the oil  company Pioneer Natural Resources. He argued among other things  that a combination of low energy prices and overly optimistic  accounting methods meant the driller was overvalued. Joking that  Pioneer was the ""motherfracker,"" Einhorn, known for his acerbic  presentations, showed dozens of slides emphasizing his point.""These companies have negative development economics, meaning  that aside from a few choice locations, they don't earn a  positive return on capital, but have a nearly infinite supply of  negative return opportunities,"" one stated, referring to Pioneer  and some of its competitors. ""What should such a supply be worth? Not much. Yet, the share prices are very high and we  believe are poised for a fall.""Now, just days before this year's Sohn conference next Wednesday, he's proved correct: Pioneer has fallen 1 percent and was down considerably more before the recent energy rally. Several other fracking companies he pooh-poohed (EOG  Resources, the ""fatherfracker,"" Continental Resources and Concho  Resources) are down substantially as well, making them some  of the few public stocks that behaved as Sohn presenters  predicted they would. Einhorn declined in an e-mail to comment for this story.So far, 2016 is treating him far better than last. The  hedge fund where he is president, Greenlight Capital, is up a  hair over 3 percent through the end of March, thanks perhaps to  his energy shorts as well as to long positions like Apple, Time Warner, Michael Kors,  and Consol  Energy. (Performance assumptions are based on Dec. 31  quarterly filings that may not reflect present positions, and  Apple shares recently slid in to negative territory for the  year.)  More current year-to-date figures for Greenlight will emerge after April's trading session ends. But the  broader hedge-fund performance numbers for 2016 so far have been  unimpressive. The typical fund fell nearly 1 percent through the  end of March, according to HFR, and big players like Citadel,  Pershing Square and Third Point fell even more.  The atmosphere is so bad that in a recent investor letter, Third  Point management described 2016 as ""one of the most catastrophic  periods of hedge fund performance that we can remember since the  inception of this fund"" and predicted that a ""washout"" in hedge  funds was soon to come.At the Sohn conference where Einhorn unveiled his drilling short, a high-profile panel of fellow hedge fund  managers touted a range of investment ideas, many of which proved  to be utter dogs.  Omega Advisors chairman Leon Cooperman pitched a handful of stocks that  subsequently sank into the red, including Actavis (now part  of Allergan), AerCap and GM; of his selections, a few others,  notably Alphabet (the former Google), rallied. Reached  for comment Thursday, Cooperman said, ""We continue to like  AerCap, Allergan, Citigroup, and Google, and we flipped the GM  and put it somewhere else. It's a long race. The game's not  over.""  Pershing Square founder Bill Ackman used the platform company Jarden — which rose  14 percent before an acquisition earlier this month — to  explain how platform companies work. But his other picks  — Platform  Specialty Products and Valeant Pharmaceuticals — have  performed terribly. (In a recent Pershing report, Ackman  acknowledged Platform's poor performance, and he has admitted a  ""failure of due diligence"" on Valeant, where he remains a large  investor.)  And Glenview Capital Management founder Larry Robbins, known for his prowess  in health care stock picking, stumbled with recommendations  on Brookdale  Senior Living and AbbVie. A Glenview official  didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, but filings  show that Glenview still holds both stocks.  Bond investor Jeffrey Gundlach, CEO of DoubleLine Capital,  suggested buying Puerto Rican municipal bonds, which have  struggled in the last year; in a public webcast in mid-April,  Gundlach said that although the general-obligation bonds had  fallen in price since his call last May, the 8 percent coupon  they offered meant that purchasing them when he made his  recommendation would have led to a zero percent return, ""which is  probably better than many asset classes.""  Gundlach also warned investors to avoid U.S. high-yield bonds,  and in the nine months that followed, they fell  precipitously.  In addition to Einhorn, who's an annual fixture at the Sohn  conference, Robbins and Gundlach are slated to return to the  event this year.

""There is no doubt that we are in the first  innings of a washout in hedge funds and certain  strategies,"" Third Point said. ""We believe we are  well-positioned to seize the opportunities borne out of this  chaos and are pleased to have preserved capital through a period  of vicious swings in treacherous markets.""  ""Volatility across asset classes and a reversal of certain trends  that started last summer caught many investors flat-footed in Q1  2016,"" the firm added.  More specifically, Loeb said:  ""We believe that the past few months of increasing complexity are  here to stay and now is a more important time than ever to employ  active portfolio management to take advantage of this  volatility,"" Loeb concluded.  As an industry, hedge funds bounced back in March after a  miserable start to 2016. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index gained 1.8 percent in March, its strongest performance since February 2015.

"        Why Bill Ackman invested $100K in these students
			                 ",2016,04,23,"   Hedge fund titan Bill Ackman is well-known for his outspoken  investments in companies like Valeant and Mondelez, as well his  very public and controversial bet against multilevel nutrition company  Herbalife. However, it's a recent investment in three Columbia  Business School students that is grabbing the attention of some  on Wall Street.   This week, the billionaire held the final elimination round to  his ""Pershing Square Challenge,"" a three-month competition that  was launched by the Pershing Square founder and CEO in 2008. Each  year, roughly 40 teams consisting of first- and second-year  Columbia Business School students compete to present their best  investment idea and thesis to Ackman and a panel of judges. This year's panel included billionaire hedge fund  manager John Paulson and CNBC ""Fast Money's"" own Karen  Finerman.  The grand prize for the winning team was  $100,000.   The 2016 winning team was a trio of female  students — Melody Li, Joanna Vu, and Thais Fernandes — who  pitched a plan to boost the stock of Canadian convenience store giant Couche-Tard.   The stock, which is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, is down  around 8 percent in 2016 and currently trading around $43 U.S.,  or $55 Canadian. The students have a two-year price target of  roughly $66.50 U.S., or $84 Canadian — more than 50 percent  higher than the current stock price.   The company has three key areas of opportunity: It's recession  resistant, flies under the radar, and management has proven  successful in the ever growing mergers and acquisition market, according to the students,   And it's that last point that attracted the eye of Finerman. The  MBA students ""talked about the acquisition runway and as  [Couche-Tard] gets bigger they are so good at doing these sorts  of rollups, and the evolution of the business from mom and pops  to big chain stores is very attractive,"" she said this week on  ""Fast Money.""   The company has more than 10,000 stores worldwide, with billions  of dollars in acquisitions, according to the company website. The  stock has a more than $25 billion market capitalization.

"        Investors pull $15 billion from hedge funds
			                 ",2016,04,20," Hedge funds have suffered their worst quarter in seven  years after more than $15 billion was pulled out by investors starting  to fight back against the high fees being charged across the  industry.  The total amount invested in hedge funds fell to $2.86 trillion in the  first three months of the year, marking the first time since 2009  that the sector has faced two consecutive quarters of net  outflows, according to data from Hedge Fund Research.  Sharp market moves have wrongfooted many firms, leading to poor  performances in the first quarter from funds such as Bill  Ackman's Pershing Square, and rankling investors already  disgruntled over fee structures charging 2 per cent for  management as well as 20 per cent of profits. A broad index of  hedge fund performance fell 0.7 per cent in the first quarter,  according to HFR.  Fed up with paying ""exorbitant fees"" for poor returns, the New  York City Employees' Retirement System has cut its $1.5 billion  program, pulling money from managers including Perry Capital  and Brevan Howard. The shift comes about 18 months after  California's pension scheme also scrapped hedge funds from its  portfolio.  At the same time, sovereign wealth funds have been withdrawing  billions from asset managers globally as they turn their  attention to supporting their own faltering oil-dependent  economies.  Letitia James, public advocate for the New York pension scheme,  attacked managers who ""balk at negotiations for  investor-favorable terms"" believing they ""could do no wrong, even  as they are losing money"". More from the Financial Times : Mutual suspicion frays historic US-Saudi tiesFund managers warned to stay off golf courseVolkswagen – the dirt under the bonnet  ""If they were truly fiduciaries and cared about our members, they  would never charge large fees for failing to deliver on their  promises,"" she said. ""Let them sell their summer homes and jets,  and return those fees to their investors.""The largest first-quarter redemptions in the sector came from  macro strategies, which saw investor outflows of $7.3 billion,  and event-driven funds, in which $8.3 billion was pulled —  more than half from activist strategies.  However, some pension funds are also boosting their exposure to  hedge funds. Finland's state scheme plans to invest $500 million  in the sector this year, while the Illinois State Universities  Retirement System is investing $500 million in hedge funds for  the first time. US insurers are also tapping the sector to help  generate returns.  Many managers, who often pool their own money alongside  investors', caution that a volatile market is the worst moment to  move away from hedged strategies.  ""More up-and-down markets with a lot of dispersion should be a  really good environment for hedge funds,"" said Judy Posnikoff, a  founding partner of Pacific Alternative Asset Management Company,  which invests in hedge funds.

"        Forget GDP, China can still derail global markets
			                 ",2016,04,15," Judging by the reaction of financial markets, traders seem encouraged by the recent round of Chinese economic data, from gross domestic product and exports to industrial production and retail sales.But those traders may be leaping to conclusions.  ""In the short term, it reinforces what we've been trying to get  investors to listen to — China is not headed for a hard  landing. Retail sales witnessing double-digit growth. Housing  market looks like it is stabilizing ... indicating that the  stimulus put in place by the central bank is starting to work,""  said Sameer Samana, global quantitative strategist at Wells Fargo  Investment Institute.  But Wall Street veterans including Samana caution that investors  should not buy into the idea of a Chinese recovery too quickly — turnarounds take time. At least  three to four months of consistently good numbers representing a gradual  rebound in China's industrial and services sectors will be needed  before any seasoned economist will be able to label China as a  ""turnaround story.""   Moreover, the earnings of major Chinese corporations would also  need to illustrate a rebound in profit and sales growth.  According to Shanghai-based financial data firm Wind Information, steel, industrial and energy companies  in 2015 posted a 45 percent or greater drop in net profits on  average. That's definitely not an encouraging sign, experts say,  given how actively the central bank was injecting liquidity into  the economy.  Analysts point to something else, as well: Neighboring trading  partners of China continue to post dismal numbers, suggesting  that the improvement in China's March data may not be  accurate.South  Korea reported a double-digit decline in first-quarter  exports. Taiwan posted weaker-than-expected March trade  data earlier this week, with exports plunging 11.4 percent and  imports dropping 17 percent year over year. Growth  in Hong Kong's  manufacturing sector came in at its lowest level since August.  And Japan's  latest Tankan Survey indicated  further deterioration in business activity and confidence.   ""With every statistic we see out of Asia, ex-China, whether it's  Taiwan, whether it's Hong Kong and other Asian countries, they're  suffering slowdowns from their sensitivity and exposure to  China,"" said Peter Boockvar, managing director of  Washington-based economic advisory firm The Lindsey Group.  Markets for years have had a sort of psychological co-dependency  on China, given its prevalence, influence and growth in the  global economy. But other macroeconomic factors at play —  volatility in currencies, rising fears over Japan's economy and  the effectiveness of global central bank policy — have  attracted some investors' attention and sidelined the awareness they normally give to China.  Strategists who spoke to CNBC said it will only take another disappointing  report from China — or a significant drop in the yuan — for  global investors to once again put the world's second-biggest economy at the top of their  worry list.  Also important is the  talk from Chinese policymakers. President Xi Jinping and central bank Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan have expressed an intent to keep the yuan  stable. Finance Minister Lou Jiwei has attempted  to inspire confidence among global investors, resulting in the offshore yuan gaining ground against a basket of  currencies.   Bets against the yuan were popular among hedge fund giants such as David Tepper and Bill Ackman. Yuan appreciation over the last two months has made that trade less tenable. Still, Beijing experts are forecasting a gradual depreciation in the Chinese currency. The  question is how global stock markets will respond to a drop in  yuan, which hurts foreign companies that do  business in China.  ""I don't think the Chinese will devalue the yuan in the near term, but if they were to do it, markets would take it negatively. It  would reintroduce the threat of competitive devaluation, which  could likely feed into other global markets,"" said Samana.  There's growing doubt about whether China will embark on another  one-off devaluation. Boockvar said that if China were to take  such a daring step, it could ruin its chances of being accepted  into the International Monetary Fund's basket of special drawing  rights currencies — IMF-issued reserve assets — in October 2016.  The onus is now on the Chinese government to continue  rehabilitating itself through aggressive reform, strategists told CNBC. Even  then, growth could slow.   William McFadden, head of China macro sales at investment bank  North Square Blue Oak, pointed out that ""The current plan of  industrial restructuring, involving capacity reduction in several  key industries, will tend to put a speed limit on overall  industrial growth, even if noncapacity challenged sectors do  grow more quickly.""",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/15/china-economy-are-traders-overestimating-its-health.html
"        Now playing near you: Ackman vs Herbalife
			                 ",2016,04,15,"   For the better part of the last few years, hedge fund  manager Bill  Ackman has been embroiled in a war of words and money with  Herbalife, a  multilevel marketing company.  Now, the activist investor's case against Herbalife is being  featured on the big screen, but viewers shouldn't expect a  Hollywood ending. ""Betting on Zero,"" a new documentary that  debuted this week at the Tribeca Film Festival, chronicles  Ackman's crusade against the company — which has done little  to dent its stock or get regulators to take the billionaire's  side.   Although his numerous broadsides against the company have yet to  take effect, including a $1 billion bet against Herbalife's  stock, Ackman continues to insist the company is little more than  a scheme that harms those involved in selling its product.  ""The real story are the people being harmed,"" who are  overwhelmingly lower-income workers and immigrants who are  Herbalife's foot soldiers, Ackman told CNBC this week, as he  appeared on the red carpet of the Tribeca Film Festival.   ""They sell people on a false business opportunity and they seduce  a group of aspiring people that came to this country to pursue  the American dream,"" he added. ""They invest three thousand, five  thousand, fifty thousand, a hundred thousand dollars"" trying to  move up the ladder, but ultimately lose money, Ackman  added. ""They lose everything,"" Ackman said, calling Herbalife's system a  ""horrible way to take advantage of people [and] ruins dreams and  aspirations.""   Herbalife has repeatedly and forcefully rebutted those claims,  which served as the basis for a brutal on-air skirmish between  Ackman and investor Carl Icahn. In 2013, the two  billionaires famously sparred in a CNBC segment, in which Icahn  branded Ackman a ""liar"" and a ""crybaby."" The two  later publicly reconciled, and Icahn remains Herbalife's biggest  individual stockholder.  The fight against Herbalife ""became a Wall Street story, a Bill  Ackman, Carl Icahn story,"" Ackman told CNBC. Herbalife's workers  ""came to America to pursue the American dream, and they ... got  ripped off ... by a pyramid scheme and they were afraid to  complain.""In a statement to CNBC on Friday, Herbalife blasted ""Betting on  Zero"" as an ""infomercial for Bill Ackman's failing portfolio.""  The company claimed that the movie failed to include commentary  from ""any of our more than 4 million current members,"" and  contended that Ackman and director Ted Braun have a decadeslong  relationship.  Meanwhile, government investigators eventually cleared the  company of any claims of being fraudulent. Probes by the FBI and  U.S. attorney's office failed to find sufficient evidence against  the company, while also clearing Ackman's closed-end fund,  Pershing Square, against claims of stock manipulation. Ackman  insisted that his sole concern was for those who may have been  harmed by Herbalife, and pledged to donate any profit from the  trade to those affected.  ""Look I'm an investor, I'm investing others peoples' money. You  know we made an investment on which we expected to make a profit  on the basis of the facts. The facts are it's a pyramid scheme, we  thought the government would do the right thing … [and] I  didn't want to personally benefit from this."" He added that he  has pledged $75 million in various philanthropic donations to a  mix of scholarships and investments in the Latino community.  In an interview with CNBC, Braun insisted that ""Betting on Zero""  was ""as balanced a film as I could make. There were  contradictions on both sides, I tried to present them as fully as  I could."" — CNBC's Jacob Pramuk contributed to this article.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/15/bill-ackmans-crusade-against-herbalife-is-now-a-movie.html

"        Don't make these 7 billion-dollar fund mistakes
			                 ",2016,04,08,"   It's hard for many people to look at hedge funds' successes  without a touch of envy, and often impossible to behold their  messes without schadenfreude. Forbes estimates that 46 of the world's billionaires  made their money in hedge funds. Yet it's not at all difficult to  recount episodes where specific hedge funds lost billions, and  hedge-fund closings are routine.   The late, great dean of value investing, Benjamin Graham, said:  ""The investor's chief problem — and even his worst  enemy — is likely to be himself.""    ""There is no perfect strategy, and there is no mistake-free  investor,"" said Justin Carbonneau, partner at Validea Capital  Management, which runs an ETF — the Validea Market  Legends ETF (VALX) — that is based on  investing models of market icons.   Here are a few recent bets made by market masters that haven't  paid off for them but offer some teachable moments for all  investors.   — By Tim Mullaney, special to  CNBC.comPosted 8 April 2016  The multibillion loss Bill Ackman's  Pershing Square Capital has taken on shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which has  plunged to $36 from $241 a share since September, has garnered plenty of headlines. (As of last  June 30, Pershing owned 19.5 million shares of Valeant. It now  owns 30.7 million and also owns derivative positions in  Valeant.) CEO Michael Pearson, who ran the putatively  Quebec-based company from New Jersey, was ousted on March 19. Ackman, 49, joined  Valeant's board in a bid to salvage the biggest loss in the  history of his fund.  Carbonneau said that the big Valeant bets like Ackman's show that investors  failed to make sure that a ""margin of safety"" existed and to  have a disciplined sell criteria. ""Prior to VRX's crash, it was trading at a very high multiple,  and when that's the case, you're really betting that the firm will  produce exceptional results. Any shortfall in earnings or other  problems and the stock can get hammered, since it's priced for  perfection."" He added, ""Ackman's mistake was focusing on  potential rather than proven results."" Another legendary investor caught up in the  Valeant free fall was the money manager Ruane, Cunniff &  Goldfarb, which runs the now $5.5 billion Sequoia Fund (SEQUX). It's a cautionary tale for all investors who think only the hedgies bet really big. The Sequoia Fund is one  of the famed mutual funds available to average investors.Sequoia achieved success by a focused approach — 70 percent of its assets in its top 10  holdings. Sequoia management said in its 2015 annual report that its  ""credibility as investors"" had been damaged by the Valeant bet.  In a more recent letter, in which it  announced the retirement of longtime CEO Robert Goldfarb, the  fund wrote, ""While we have beaten the market over the past  decade, through the end of 2015, our investment in Valeant has  diminished a record that we have built over two generations.""Valeant and its backers  said it was a ""risk-free"" drug company version of Berkshire  Hathaway, but New Yorker financial writer James Surowiecki noted, ""The attempt to evade  risk turned out to be the riskiest strategy of all.""  A hedge fund investor, Centerbridge Partners, may call a default on Valeant, citing the company's inability to file its annual report on time, according to a Wall Street Journal report on Tuesday, April 12.  Icahn has made some great trades lately. One example: the  billions he made on Netflix when investors soured on the company. The  Netflix trade was notable for the fact that Icahn got out with a  big gain, even though the stock has continued higher. What had been his biggest recent holding, Apple, is one Icahn told CNBC on April 28 he'd finally cashed in, making in the range of $2 billion.It could take Icahn a lot longer to generate value from some  other big bets in the energy sector.  Icahn has blown a good chunk of his $20 billion  fortune on shares of Chesapeake Energy, one of the most aggressive drillers  for shale oil and gas and a company that got hit hard when oil  prices began their historic plunge in 2014.  The good news for Icahn: His 73 million shares of Chesapeake  represented only 1 percent of his portfolio as of Dec. 31,  according to WhaleWisdom, a service that watches giant investors.  The bad: Energy represented 16 percent of Icahn's portfolio even  after a tough 2015 for energy stocks. His companies' losses on  Chesapeake, Cheniere  Energy and refining company CVR  Energy each totaled $1 billion or more.   David Einhorn built a billionaire fortune largely on big  short-selling bets against financials. but,  like Icahn, has stubbed his toe on energy bets. His Greenlight Capital has been buying Consol Energy, now at $11, since it  was in the $30s. Consol is the lowest-cost coal producer in  Appalachia and also has natural gas interests. His bet is that  Consol will be the last coal producer standing, ready to supply a  big chunk of the 25 percent of U.S. electricity that will come  from coal after global-warming rules are implemented. (Coal, once  60 percent of electricity, will supply 30 percent this year,  according to the Energy Information Administration, and 2016  will be the first year that natural gas surpasses coal generation  annually).   Year-to-date, Consol is up 46 percent, though still down 60  percent in the past year. Consol and Einhorn may get there, but  it will be a tough ride. Ask Carl Icahn.   In 2015, three stock positions cost Einhorn as much as three  percent of capital in a calendar year — the first time that ever  happened: Consol Energy, Micron Technology and SunEdison,  which may file for bankruptcy, according to  many recent press reports. An old investing adage advises to be  happy if you miss out on the final 20 percent of gains in a stock  that has already done well. Greenlight told investors that maybe it  should have monetized gains in these stocks when they were  higher.""We run a concentrated portfolio. Our  philosophy is to invest the most capital in ideas where we have  the most conviction. Unfortunately, a good process does not  prevent mistakes, nor does it guarantee good outcomes, especially  on a short-term basis,"" Greenlight wrote.  The Oracle of Omaha is usually a peerless picker of classic  American blue-chip stocks — except this time.  Berkshire Hathaway began assembling what's now a $11.9 billion  position in IBM in  2011, at average prices of about $170 a share, he said on CNBC  last year. IBM's now at $147, up about $10 this year. As hedge fund boners go, this isn't the biggest. But this is  Buffett we're talking about. ""It seems like he violated one of his  own rules with IBM, which is that you should invest within your  core competency,"" Carbonneau said. In a sense, the core competency problem was why Buffett chose IBM and not Apple, Facebook or Google to make his tech bet in. He wanted the least ""techie"" of the tech bets. But in the recent bull market run, it's been the high-growth tech firms that have been most richly rewarded.Carbonneau said a good lesson from Buffett's bet on IBM is that when an investor goes outside a sweet spot, take it slowly. ""In retrospect it seems that his mistake was not  necessarily going outside of his core competency, but doing so in  such a big move,"" he said. ""When you are venturing into unfamiliar waters,  you probably want to dip your toe first rather than diving in  headfirst.""For the record, Buffett continues to show faith in IBM, unlike another recent dog pick of his, Tesco, which he bailed on after performance shortfalls were followed by an accounting scandal. Buffett said his mistakes in the Tesco case were simple: first, he, and no one else, got the facts wrong, and then, he ""thumb-sucked"" for too long before selling. Traders can mess up by picking the wrong company or by  diagnosing trends wrong. When they do both, it's a doozy.Billionaire hedge fund manager Lampert, who founded ESL Investments, has lost billions on his position in Sears Holdings,  which has dropped to $15 a share from $175 since 2007 (Lampert  joined the board in 2005 and became Sears' CEO and chairman in 2013). That's an eerie note to Ackman, now on the Valeant board, about how long it might take to turn around a failed bet.One premise of Lampert's investment was that  Sears' real estate holdings, including anchor-store positions at  shopping malls, would be valuable even if the core retail  franchise suffered. But retail has been unkind to department  stores in general, making those spaces less coveted. Declining  revenue, big losses and the spin-off of the unsuccessful Lands  End acquisition are all negatives. Sears is closing about  50 stores this year in a bid to stop declines in same-store  revenues.  Lampert controls 53 percent of Sears, according to its 2015 proxy  statement, and another famed investor, Fairholme Capital honcho Bruce Berkowitz, owns  about a quarter of the company, joining the board in March 2016  after first investing in 2005. He still believes in the  company's real estate, too. But skeptics abound: ""Someone's going  to be left holding the bags, and those bags are not going to be  worth much,"" a distressed-debt investor told TheStreet.com in  March.Another cautionary tale for mutual fund investors, especially those stretching for income in a low-rate world, as well as any investor taking comfort in ""legendary"" names in the fund market. Third Avenue Management's chairman is widely respected value investor Martin Whitman, and the firm has been long known for its flagship $1.3 billion Third Avenue Value Fund (TVFVX). Whitman made his name during the heyday of active mutual fund managers by beating the market picking value stocks.But last December, it was the $800 million Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund that became the largest of at least three funds to fail in the teeth  of the drop in the junk bond market, stemming from the collapse in  oil prices. Stripped to essentials, Third Avenue, a  mutual fund rather than a hedge fund, tried to goose its returns  by loading up on the junkiest junk: Even before it began to  implode, it had nearly 20 percent of its holdings in the lowest-rated,  most illiquid debt securities.  As investors got more worried about energy last year, the spread  between junk bond yields that concentrated in the energy business and  investment-grade government debt got ever wider as the price of  junk fell. That sparked investor redemptions that Third Avenue  ultimately couldn't meet. ""Third Avenue Focused Credit was a  collection of the worst pieces of garbage under one roof that I  have ever seen,"" CNBC's Jim Cramer said after the collapse.Third Avenue is currently in the process of returning capital to shareholders ""in as timely a manner as possible,"" according to a shareholder letter. For the record, the majority of its assets are in other mutual funds.  While the hedge fund industry in its modern form is only about 30  years old, there has never been a shortage of investing blunders  to review courtesy of the brightest, brashest minds stalking the  market. And the recent stumbles sure don't compare to the really  big ones, like John Meriwether and Long-Term Capital Management  in 1998.   But being on the wrong side of big trades, even smaller ones, is  one reason the average hedge fund has trailed the S&P 500  each of the last four years. Meanwhile, Warren Buffett's famous  bet that the broader market would beat a collection of  the best hedge funds over 10 years is now eight years old, with  the market way ahead.   The allure of the big score keeps people talking about hedge  funds: Giant fortunes can be built when a previously obscure firm  is right just once. ""All of these picks highlight a broader  issue that is evident but often glossed over when people talk  about investment gurus,"" Carbonneau said. ""There  are far too many moving parts in the stock market for anyone to  figure it all out. ... Good investing is about finding a good  strategy and sticking to it through the inevitable ups and downs  of the market.""  Carbonneau said that even Graham, who is a legend and essentially  created value investing from scratch, had an imperfect model. His  approach was brilliant in assessing valuation at a particular  moment in time, but it overlooked the quality of the company,  which can open the door for some value traps. Buffett built on  Graham's imperfect approach by adding in quality metrics such as  return on equity and capital and retained earnings, and someday  (if not already) someone will improve on Buffett's imperfect  approach, too, Carbonneau said.

"        Ackman: Valeant board may find new CEO in weeks
			                 ",2016,04,06,"   Billionaire investor Bill Ackman on Wednesday said the board of  embattled drug maker Valeant  Pharmaceuticals could find a new  chief executive officer in ""weeks"" and said  the stock will become ""investable"" again  once the annual report is filed.Speaking on an investor conference call Wednesday, Ackman said  Valeant is now on track to deliver its  delayed 10-K by month end which will likely  give the company a shot in the arm because  investors will look at the company  anew. Pershing Square Capital  Management blocked off one hour on Wednesday morning for  Ackman and his analysts to walk investors through exactly how one  of its funds lost 25 percent in the first three months of 2016,  including bets on Platform Specialty Products, Herbalife and  Valeant.  The losses are a severe blow for one of the hedge fund industry's  most closely followed investors and come on top of a record 20.5  percent drop in 2015.A spokesman for Ackman declined to comment.   Five months ago Ackman held a call that lasted nearly four hours  as he tried convince investors that Valeant was still a good buy.  That message seemed to fall on deaf ears as the stock price has  tumbled nearly 70 percent since then. Ackman lost roughly  $1 billion on his Valeant investment in one day last month  when its stock fell 50 percent on fears it could default. That  prompted even long-time Valeant supporters such as Brave Warrior  Advisors' Glenn Greenberg to liquidate half of his stake.Overall, Ackman's investors appear to be sticking with him.  Redemption requests for the first quarter totaled roughly 2  percent of the firm's roughly $12 billion in assets.  ""This is going to be a badly scraped knee that may even require  stitches but it is not life threatening,"" one Ackman investor  said about the losses and Valeant situation.  The structure of Pershing Square shields it from a sudden sharp  loss of capital -  investors can only withdraw their money  gradually and some of them can only exit by selling shares to  another investor.   In a rare piece of good news, Valeant said on Tuesday that it has  finished an internal review and found no additional problems that  would require further restatements of its financial statements.  Its shares climbed 10 percent. — CNBC's Mary Thompson and Krysia Lenzo contributed to this report. ",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/04/06/ackman-to-face-investor-grilling-after-record-quarterly-loss.html

"        How Leda Braga is beating the market this year
			                 ",2016,03,11,"   If you're struggling to make money in your portfolio lately,  you're in good company.  Hedge fund luminaries have not been knocking the cover off the  ball either, with high-profile managers like David Einhorn and  Bill Ackman  losing more than 20 percent in 2015. Overall hedge fund  performance has been lackluster so far this year, too.  However, there is a part of the industry that is quietly killing  it — it's not the ""Masters of the  Universe"" — it's the machines. Computer-driven or  ""systematic"" strategies (also called Commodity Trading Advisers  or CTAs) are beating the humans.Data from Hedge Fund  Research shows systematic managers are up 5.6 percent through February.  That's compared with a 2 percent drop for the firm's index of hedge  funds overall. The Societe Generale index of CTAs is up even more  with a gain of 7.3 percent through February.So, what is working for  the machines that the humans are missing? According to the oft-called ""most powerful woman in hedge funds,"" Leda Braga of  Systematica investments, the machines have the edge when betting  on stocks going down.   ""Going short is hard for discretionary traders. It just is,""  Braga said via email. ""Perhaps it is human nature that we all  prefer to find things we like and buy them than to find things we  don't and bet against them. A systematic model has no emotion, so  CTAs take short positions very competently.""  While she may not be getting emotional, Braga must be feeling  pretty good about her year. Amid all the headlines of hedge fund  closures and poor performance, Systematica has grown from $7.9  billion in outside capital when the firm launched in January 2015 to assets now north of $10 billion. Helping to  attract investors is her performance, with her flagship fund up  9.8 percent this year and 3.4 percent last year.  Funds such as Systematica make money by identifying trends across  stocks, bonds, currencies and commodities. A big trend that Braga  credits for outperformance this year is her bet to go long bonds.  ""No discretionary trader wants to run that position,"" Braga said.  ""They missed on it in 2014, too, whereas we capitalized in full on  it. We can do it because we operate in a more diversified manner,  so it is OK to be contrarian. When you only hold a handful of  positions, it is harder to go against consensus.""  The fund also benefited from bets against energy and stocks. In March, as the markets have rallied some performance  was given back and the model adjusted accordingly. In fact, the  fund has reduced risk and already started to get long in some  equity markets.      The outperformance of systematic funds is attracting money to the  computer-driven approach. A recent report from Barclays shows  hedge fund investors have increased their allocation to  computer-driven strategies to 11 percent from 7 percent. And as Systematica has  grown assets, the firm's former parent company, Michael Platt's  BlueCrest, opted to shut down to investors other than its partners. It returned billions of dollars to outside  investors in December.  And it looks as if the money may keep flowing to the machines.  According to a recent report from Preqin, CTAs are expected to  attract some of the biggest inflows from hedge fund investors in  2016.  Fund marketer and consultant Don Steinbrugge of Agecroft Partners  said he's ""seeing a significant pickup in demand because a lot of  people are worried about capital markets right now and looking to  diversify, and CTAs have done well recently.""   Of course, the key question is whether the machines will continue  to outperform. As they say, past performance is no guarantee of  future results, and systematic strategies have had lumpy  performance in recent years. According to Stephen Weiss of Short  Hills Capital, ""CTA/systematic strategies require very specific  inputs for them to be successful such as the recent high  volatility in the market. When the inputs built into their models  become ineffective, they will underperform.""  And that's where the quant faithful reiterate their deep-seated  belief in the superior intelligence of the data. Braga responds,  ""Trend following went through a tough patch of about three years.  The world has moved on since and we have gotten better at what we  do. I often say that we have gone through a three-year diet and  we have exercised, too, so we are fitter than ever.""  Roy Niederhoffer of R.G. Niederhoffer Capital Management, a quant  fund that's up 16 percent this year, would also tell you that the  key is to stick to your knitting through the ups and the downs.  As he said recently on the Halftime Report ""We follow the systems. That's the  point. A quantitative strategy needs to take the emotion out of  it and that's the value of using a system and not your emotion.  I've learned to follow my model because it's a lot better than I  am.""  C-3PO couldn't have said it better.

"        Valeant at center of Ackman fund information request
			                 ",2016,03,25,"   U.S. legislators investigating price hikes in the pharmaceutical  industry have asked William Ackman's hedge fund for information  on Valeant  Pharmaceuticals, according to a person familiar with the  matter.  Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management owns a 9  percent stake in Valeant and is the Canadian drug company's third  largest investor.  On Thursday, Ackman told his investors that Pershing Square  received a request for information a week ago from the U.S.  Senate Special Committee on Aging. Ackman said his fund was  cooperating with the probe, but he did not give details on what  was being sought by lawmakers in his letter to clients.  ""The request is directly related to Valeant,"" the person familiar  with the matter told Reuters on Friday.  Valeant has sparked public outrage and been criticized by U.S.  lawmakers for dramatically hiking the price of older drugs.   The Canadian company has disclosed several investigations,  including the one from Congress and probes by the Securities and  Exchange Commission and U.S. Attorney's offices in Massachusetts  and New York.Pershing Square has lost billion of dollars, on paper, as  Valeant's stock price tumbled some 85 percent in the last year  amid questions about its pricing strategy plus its business and  accounting practices.  Ackman formally joined Valeant's board on Monday. Separately, investors in Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which makes the first drug to treat low sexual desire in  women and was bought by Valeant last year, say the drug has been priced too high, Bloomberg reported on Friday.By overcharging for the drug and neglecting to market it, Valeant has undercut the commercial success of the drug,  called Addyi, Bloomberg reported, citing a letter from Sprout shareholders.  Valeant priced Addyi at $800 a month even though Sprout had established a price point of about $400 a month based on  market research, the investor group wrote in the letter sent to  Valeant on March 14, according to Bloomberg.  The group represented all of Sprout shareholders at the  time of its sale to the Canadian drug company for $1 billion in August.  Addyi, whose chemical name is flibanserin, is designed for premenopausal women whose lack of sexual desire causes  distress.   The condition is formally known as hypoactive sexual desire disorder, or HSDD. The drug needs to be taken daily.  Addyi has been nicknamed the ""female Viagra"" even though it does not work like Pfizer's blockbuster Viagra pill for  men that in 1998 became the first approved drug for erectile dysfunction.  Due to the higher price point, insurance companies refused to cover the drug, helping to make it unaffordable for  millions of women, the investors group said.  The investors requested materials showing that Valeant can fulfill its obligations under the merger agreement going forward, Bloomberg reported. They are seeking evidence that Valeant plans to spend $200 million for marketing and  research and development for 2016 and half of 2017, as part of the agreement, it added, citing the letter.  The group also seeks assurance that Valeant will keep a sales force of 150 to distribute Addyi.   In response, Valeant said it was continuing to work closely with pharmacists, healthcare providers, and patients to  educate them about the drug.  ""Valeant intends to comply with all of its obligations  under our agreement with the former shareholders of Sprout,  including, as they relate to marketing spend, number of sales reps,  and post-marketing studies,"" said Laurie Little, a Valeant spokeswoman.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/25/valeant-at-center-of-ackman-fund-information-request.html
"        Gilead ordered to pay Merck $200M in damages
			                 ",2016,03,25,"   The federal jury in a patent trial has ordered drugmaker Gilead  Sciences to pay Merck $200 million in damages for infringing on  patents for hepatitis C drugs.The award is far below the damages Merck sought, but  the trial moves to a new phase Wednesday. The jury, in San Jose,  California, then will decide whether Merck is due  royalties on sales of Gilead's hepatitis C drugs, Harvoni and  Sovaldi.  Merck, which recently launched a hepatitis C drug called  Zepatier, claims two patents that Merck and partner Ionis  Pharmaceuticals filed in 2002 were the basis for Gilead's  sofosbuvir. That's the active ingredient in Sovaldi and part of  combination drug Harvoni, which are among the world's  top-grossing medicine franchises.  The two Gilead drugs had 2015 worldwide sales of $19.1 billion,  mostly in the U.S. That's nearly two-thirds of all revenue for  Gilead Sciences, a biologic drugmaker based in Foster City,  California.  Merck, which is based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, sought damages  amounting to 10 percent of U.S. sales of Harvoni and Sovaldi  through the end of 2015, which totaled $23.1 billion. It's also  seeking royalties of 10 percent of the U.S. sales of the two  drugs from Jan. 1, 2016 on.  Gilead said it will appeal the $200 million award the jury  ordered Thursday night, if a judge upholds it.  ""Since Merck made no contribution and assumed none of the risk in  the discovery and development of sofosbuvir, we do not believe  Merck is entitled to any amount of damages. We continue to  believe the Merck patents are invalid,"" Gilead said.  However, the federal judge overseeing the case ruled a month ago  that Gilead's two medicines did infringe on the patents. Then on  Tuesday, the jury upheld the validity of the two patents, which  Merck and Ionis Pharmaceuticals filed in 2002 for ""compounds and  methods"" to treat patients infected with the hepatitis C virus.  Merck claimed that Pharmasset, a company Gilead bought for $11  billion in 2011 to gain the rights to then-experimental drug  sofosbuvir, used information in the 2002 patents to develop  sofosbuvir. Merck said it, Ionis Pharmaceuticals of Carlsbad,  California, and their partners spent years and significant money  working on the patents.  Gilead denies any patent infringement, saying Pharmasset began  working on sofosbuvir's development in 2001.  According to Merck, Gilead initiated the litigation by seeking a  declaratory judgment that the Merck and Ionis patents were  invalid.  ""The jury's verdict upholds patent protections that are essential  to the development of new medical treatments,"" Merck said late  Thursday.  Patents guarantee drugmakers exclusive sales for a decade or  more, before generic competition is allowed, so the companies can  recoup their investment and use profits to then develop new  medicines.  Merck won U.S. approval on Jan. 28 for Zepatier, and priced it  well under Harvoni's list price of $94,000 per treatment course.  That set up a battle for favorable formulary positions, and thus  more sales, from insurers and prescription benefit managers.  Merck was one of two dominant makers of hepatitis C treatments  until Gilead's drugs were approved. Those drugs, as well as  Merck's Zepatier and new ones from a few other rivals, have  revolutionized treatment for hepatitis C. About 3 million  Americans and millions more elsewhere have the liver-destroying,  bloodborne virus.  Prior generations of hepatitis C medicines required a year of  treatment and caused flu-like and other side effects, yet barely  cured half of patients. The new drugs cure about 95 percent of  patients in eight to 12 weeks, but their high prices have  strained the budgets of insurers and government health programs.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/25/gilead-ordered-to-pay-merck-200m-for-patent-infringement.html
"        Valeant board ousted CEO Pearson: Source
			                 ",2016,03,21,"  Valeant  Pharmaceuticals, whose stock has fallen 73 percent this year  amid U.S. investigations of its business and accounting  practices, announced Monday that CEO Mike Pearson is leaving. The  board ousted Pearson after a series of weekend phone calls, a  decision that ""was not mutual"" according to a person familiar  with the situation.  The same source tells CNBC, Valeant's board informed Pearson of the action it was taking — to immediately initiate a search for  the next CEO,  and that he was no longer in the company's  long-term plans. In a Monday statement, the board also announced that activist investor Bill Ackman is joining the  board. Former CFO Howard Schiller refused to leave the board to  make room for Ackman.  Shares of Valeant closed up 7 percent on Monday. Over 9 million shares were traded in the first 10  minutes of trading.  Valeant said that Pearson will stay on as CEO until his successor  is found.  Former Medtronic CEO Bill George told CNBC's ""Closing Bell"" that he doesn't think Pearson  should be the interim CEO and that the board should tap Bob  Ingram, formerly of GlaxoSmithKline, instead.  ""They have to take the lid off of this company and really  get under the covers and find out what's going on. Until Pearson  is out of there, they can't do that,"" George said.  George, who is also a CNBC contributor, also said that  Valeant's business model is unsustainable and that it should sell  off some of its acquired businesses to deal with its debt  situation. Ultimately, some transparency is also needed, he noted.  ""We don't have any information about what's going on at  this company. We just get bits and pieces,"" he said. ""Honestly, the activist hedge funds like Bill  Ackman and Value Act have been remarkably patient, maybe too  patient here.""  Last week, the stock closed down more than 51 percent in one day  when the company slashed its 2016  revenue forecast and said that a delay in filing its  annual report could pose a debt default risk.  ""While we regret the circumstances that have resulted in the  delay of our 10-K filing, we are committed to filing the 10-K on  or before April 29, 2016,"" Pearson said in a statement Monday.  The Canadian drugmaker came under fire when The New York  Times reported that Valeant and other pharmaceutical  companies were using a network of specialty pharmacies to sustain  sales of their high-priced drugs and prevent patients and  insurers from switching to cheaper generic drugs. Citron Research  subsequently published a note calling Valeant the ""pharmaceutical  Enron.""  In response, Valeant formed an ad hoc committee to review the  allegations regarding specialty pharmacy Philidor RX Services.  The U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission is investigating the relationship between the  two companies.  ""It's been a privilege to lead Valeant for the past eight years.  While I regret the controversies that have adversely impacted our  business over the past several months, I know that Valeant is a  strong and resilient company, and I am committed to doing  everything I can to ensure a smooth transition to new  leadership,"" Pearson said in the statement.  Valeant initially requested Schiller to step down from the board,  but Schiller ""has not done so,"" according to the company's  statement.  ""As a result of the fact that I did not engage in any improper  conduct regarding this proposed restatement, I have respectfully  declined the request from the Company's Board to resign from the  Board,"" Schiller said in a statement.  ""We are aware of Mr. Schiller's views, and the company stands by  its statement in the company's press release and 8-K,"" said  Laurie Little, Valeant's senior vice president of investor  relations.  Katharine Stevenson volunteered to resign instead to create the  vacancy for Ackman.  ""I am looking forward to working with the board to identify new  leadership for Valeant,"" Ackman said in a statement. ""On behalf  of all shareholders, we are extremely appreciative of Valeant  employees' hard work and commitment during this challenging time  for the company.""  Ackman's firm owns a 9 percent stake in Valeant.  Last week, Ackman sent an email to  investors promising to take a more proactive role at  Valeant. In his email he reiterated that Pershing continues to  ""believe that the value of the underlying business franchises  that comprise Valeant are worth multiples of the current market  price.""

"        S&P puts Ackman's Pershing Square on watch negative
			                 ",2016,03,17,"   It's been a tough week for billionaire investor Bill Ackman, and longtime  investors are debating the health of his firm, Pershing Square.  News that Ackman sold down his Mondelez position by 20 million shares  on Wednesday night, just a day after losing $1 billion dollars on  paper in Valeant, raised a flurry of new  questions. His fund is down 9 percent this week and 26 percent  year-to-date. Pershing Square's value has also declined  47-percent from its high reached just back in July of last year.On Thursday, Standard and Poor's placed Pershing Square Holdings' ""BBB"" issuer credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on watch negative. The agency cited the firm's drop in net asset value, ""largely because of a precipitous decline"" in Valeant shares.   In a letter to investors on Wednesday night, Ackman said the  Mondelez sale was for ""rebalancing,"" as the position grew  outsized, compared to other holdings, like that of Valeant, which  have dropped in value. That sparked wild speculation about  whether Ackman might have gotten a margin call, or something  else.  Ackman denied that claim to CNBC on Thursday morning, saying, ""We  don't use margin leverage — never have and never will.""  Other investors speculated that Ackman might be preparing for a  wave of redemptions prompted by his portfolio's recent declines,  which he said was not the case.  Ackman said just 2 percent  of Pershing Square's assets,  which total more than $11  billion — was redeemed on Feb. 15, the most recent  opportunity to do so. Much of the negative Valeant news was  already widely known at that time, though the shares had not yet  taken the biggest plunge.  As of Feb. 15, Ackman said, some  83 percent of his investors who could have cashed out instead  rolled their money ahead and remained in the fund.   One long-term Ackman investor told CNBC on Thursday that he has  no desire to leave. ""We're sticking with him for sure"" the  investor said, pointing to Ackman's long-term track record, which  he called stellar.   He also pointed out successful bets in the Howard Hughes Corp.,  Air Products and several others as reasons to remain optimistic.  The investor further blamed bad press for much of Ackman's ills.   ""Generally speaking, it's been all negative and there's  been a piling on effect as a result.""The next redemption opportunity for Pershing investors won't come  around until mid-May, Ackman noted, but he says he's optimistic  his investors will stay in the fund, going into detail about why  the firm's financial position is solid.  Ackman said Pershing Square has large cash balances in every one  of its funds — averaging 14 to 15 percent throughout the  portfolio.  He also pointed to three sources of so-called ""permanent  capital,"" or money that can't be redeemed — $4 billion  dollars from his publicly traded vehicle, Pershing Square  Holdings, which is traded in Amsterdam; $1 billion dollars from a  recent bond offering; and just more than a billion or so in what  Ackman described as ""employee capital."" He called other money  ""long-term lock-up capital"" where investors remain highly  restricted in how they can redeem their money. As is common in  many hedge funds – it could take Ackman's investors up to  two-years to get all of their cash back.  On the issue of Valeant – where Ackman has suffered steep  losses lately — he admitted the challenges ahead but said he  could help fix the company —  ""Valeant is a problem,  but we know what to do,"" he said.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/17/ackman-defends-pershing-squares-financial-strength.html

"        Short seller and Mallinckrodt CEO go head-to-head
			                 ",2016,03,15,"   In a heated exchange on Tuesday, Andrew Left, a short seller  and founder and executive editor of Citron Research, took on Mallinckrodt's CEO, Mark  Trudeau, about the value of his pharmaceutical company and how it  differs from Valeant.  Left, who called the decline in Valeant back in October, told CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on  Tuesday that Mallinckrodt makes Valeant look like a ""choirboy"" by  comparison.  ""I think Mallinckrodt is worse because they are dependent on one  drug, close to let's say 50 percent of their EBITDA, depends on  what metric you want to look at, is dependent on one particular  drug. Not let's say 30 that Valeant has,"" said Left.   He said there is no reason Mallinckrodt is any different  than Valeant, and that the company's drug Acthar,  which is used to treat seizures in babies, is the  ""poster child"" of price gouging.  Skeptics have focused on Mallinckrodt's acquisition of  Questcor in August 2014, which makes Acthar, which is a drug whose pricing  was raised from $40 to more than $28,000 a vial over a decade,  according to The New York  Times.  Mallinckrodt shares  have been sliding since late October, when Citron published the now  infamous ""Valeant: Could this be the Pharmaceutical  Enron?"" report.   Shares of the Dublin-based Mallinckrodt are down more  than 50 percent over the past 12 months, and fell more than 10 percent  on Tuesday.  In response to these claims, Trudeau fired back in the same  ""Fast Money"" segment, defending his company's reputation and  rebutting Left's comments.   ""The marketplace certainly pulled down Valeant today, and I want  to be clear Mallinckrodt is absolutely not Valeant,"" said  Trudeau. ""First and foremost, Mallinckrodt is a  well-diversified, strong company. We're transparent. Our strength  is both operational and financial.""   Trudeau added that Mallinckrodt delivered a very strong fiscal  first quarter, which built on the momentum the  company saw in the fourth quarter. He noted that Acthar  represents less than one-third of the company's  business, and it's growing at about 8 percent per year.  ""We have a solid balance sheet. Very strong cash flow,"" he added.  ""We actually raised earnings per share guidance for the year. So, we've been delivering consistently and exceeding shareholder  expectations. We have a very strong, solid business model. Well-diversified with excellent brands we're investing in and driving value across the board.""   Still, Left argued that you could take Trudeau's exact  response and ""take the word Mallinckrodt out and put Valeant  in."" — CNBC's Tae Kim contributed to this report.

"        Cramer: Why stocks refused to be crushed
			                 ",2016,03,15,"   The Dow Jones industrial average opened more than 100 points in  the red on Tuesday, yet stocks refused to be crushed. Jim Cramer  considered this real resilience, as the Dow continued to  keep fighting and closed slightly higher at the end of the day.  ""It can take a jab, absorb multiple uppercuts, and it simply  won't stay down, let alone lay flat on the canvas,"" the ""Mad  Money"" host said.  With a plethora of negative events rolling in on Tuesday, Cramer  ticked each one off as he went down the list:  First, former market darling Valeant had its share price cut in  half in a single session. While it had the backing of big  names such as hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman, it came under  the spotlight after Hillary Clinton lambasted it for raising drug prices and after wider criticism of its business model. Cramer found it strange that there  was almost no pin action on to other stocks.   The market also shrugged off the horrendous  retail numbers reported. February sales fell 0.1 percent, and  even worse, January sales were revised down to negative 0.4  percent.  ""I cannot stress enough just how horrible this news is,"" Cramer  said. Read more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer Cramer Remix: Biggest break-up since Ben  & Jen Cramer: 6 groups in fabulous bull market  mode Cramer on tobacco: Stinking up your  portfolio?  When January sales were initially reported, the market rallied.  When they were revised down on Tuesday stocks refused to sink and  Cramer interpreted this as a sign of strength.  The third negative event was the nasty decline in crude oil. After  months of panic every time the price of oil dropped, it didn't  even blink. Exxon Mobil actually went higher and it seems to Cramer that there  are buyers lurking underneath everywhere in oil these days.  Europe was also hammered, and lately the U.S. market has been  trading in lockstep with Europe. Meanwhile, on the eve of the Fed decision on Wednesday, stocks did not trade in sync with Europe.  ""If Janet Yellen and company believe the economy is too strong,  then we are going to get a rate hike, maybe as early as June. Who  knows, if they want to do a little shock treatment, they could  give us one tomorrow, although that would likely be disastrous,""  Cramer said.  Cramer speculated that the fearless nature of buyers stemmed from  positive news that neutralized the negativity, such as the  Chinese buyer stepping forward to bid for Starwood or the bid Fresh  Market received from a private equity company. He said a lot of money recently has chased only a few companies.  ""As much as buyers should be more cautious here, every time it  looks like this fighting stock market is about to go down for the  count, it shakes off the punches and comes right back at you,""  Cramer said.  Ultimately Tuesday ended in a draw. But it could have been a  knockout, and the fact that it wasn't was a huge victory for the  bulls.  Questions for Cramer?

"        Valeant plummets 51% on guidance cut, default risk
			                 ",2016,03,15,"   Shares of Valeant  Pharmaceuticals tumbled on Tuesday after the company cut  its 2016 revenue forecast by about 12 percent and said a delay in  filing its annual report could pose a debt default risk.  The stock closed down more than 51 percent on Tuesday.  One of its big investors, Bill Ackman, said he is still confident in  Valeant and he plans to be more proactive in his dealings with  it. However short seller Andrew Left of Citron Research told  CNBC's ""Fast Money"" on Thursday that the price drop in Valeant is a  reflection of the problems with the company's business model.  ""If you look at what we saw today, really it was an unwind of the  whole platform strategy, how Valeant goes about repairing their  business. ... How are they going to make these franchises more  valuable than when they acquired them without having to raise  prices? That's obviously difficult,"" Left explained.  For the full year, the company expects earnings of $9.50 to  $10.50 a share. Revenue was seen at $11 billion to $11.2 billion,  compared with its previous estimate of $12.5 billion to $12.7  billion.  The Canadian drugmaker, the target of U.S. investigations into  its business and accounting practices, reiterated that it would  put off filing its annual report with U.S. regulators but for the  first time raised the specter of a default.  Valeant said failure to file the report by Tuesday's deadline  would mean it would be in breach of a covenant, and that holders  of at least 25 percent of any series of notes may deliver a  notice of default. Defaulting on debt could prompt lenders to  demand faster repayment and place restrictions on Valeant's  ability to borrow further.  Left added that from the intraday move on Tuesday, it's clear the  market is pricing in the possibility of a default. With that said Left said he's not tempted to buy or short the stock here.""There has to be better places for me to deploy my capital. At the end of the day, Valeant is a black box,"" he said.  As of Sept. 30, Valeant had about $30 billion of long-term debt.  The company said it would repay at least $1.7 billion this year,  down from an earlier forecast of $2.25 billion.  However, Chief Executive Officer Michael Pearson said he was  ""comfortable"" with the company's liquidity and expected Valeant  to meet obligations.  ""Our business is not operating on all cylinders, but we are  committed to getting it back on track,"" said Pearson, who  returned last month from a medical leave of absence.  Valeant, which has rapidly expanded in recent years through  acquisitions, is now looking to sell noncore assets, Pearson  said, without being specific.  The company said last month it would delay filing its annual  report while a board committee looked into its accounting  practices. It also said it would restate 2014 and 2015 financial  statements.  Valeant's troubles began late last year when questions were  raised about its drug pricing and allegations emerged that it was  using distributor Philidor RX Services to inflate revenue in its  dermatology business.  Laval, Quebec-based Valeant has since cut ties with Philidor,  which has gone out of business.  Valeant is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and  Exchange Commission over its relationship with Philidor, Reuters  has reported. The company is also the subject of U.S. state  investigations for steep price increases on some drugs.  The company posted fourth-quarter adjusted earnings per share of  $2.50, compared with $2.58 a share in the year-earlier period.  Revenue for the quarter came in at $2.79 billion, hurt by  softer-than-expected sales in its gastrointestinal  business.  Analysts had expected Valeant to report adjusted earnings of  about $2.61 a share on $2.75 billion in revenue, according  to a consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.  The embattled company also reduced its first-quarter and  full-year outlook. Valeant now forecasts first-quarter earnings  of $1.30 to $1.55 a share, on revenue of $2.3 billion to $2.4  billion.  It all comes as high drug prices have been central to rhetoric  from presidential hopefuls like Hillary Clinton.  Ackman sent an email to investors on Tuesday saying the  board of his Pershing Square Holdings will take a more proactive role at Valeant given the new  guidance. The letter also said that Pershing Square Holdings sees  value in the pharmaceutical company and will protect its  investment in Valeant.    ""We continue to believe that the value of the underlying business  franchises that comprise Valeant are worth multiples of the  current market price,"" Ackman wrote in the email. ""Getting to  those values, however, will require restoration of shareholder  confidence in the management and governance of the company.""  — CNBC's Christine Wang and Krysia Lenzo contributed to this report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/15/valeant-pharmaceuticals-reports-fourth-quarter-2015-earnings.html
"        Cramer: Best performers from the Haines bottom
			                 ",2016,03,09,"   Seven years ago, the market hit rock bottom, and late CNBC  journalist Mark Haines called it in a moment now known as the Haines bottom. To mark the anniversary, Jim Cramer took a look at many of the stocks winning since 2009, noting that many of the top performers were accessible to investors  at the time.  ""You could have spotted some of the top 15 gainers since the  Haines bottom, and those who say otherwise just don't want you to  feel empowered about making your own investments. I guess they  think you're stupid; I don't,"" the ""Mad Money"" host said.  Before reviewing the best performers, Cramer reiterated his  mantra that one should not even think about investing in an  individual stock until the first $10,000 is invested into an  index fund, as he prefers their diversification and low  costs.   Additionally stock picking can be a high-risk proposition, thus  only discretionary, non-retirement funds should be used to invest,  also known as ""Mad Money.""  The best performer was General Growth Properties, which Cramer  recognized could have been a bit hard to spot. It went in and out  of bankruptcy and rebounded faster than anyone thought possible  with the help of hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.  The second best performer could have been achievable, Cramer  said. Regeneron was the first guest on ""Mad Money"" and Cramer has  recommended it based on its medicine to stabilize macular  degeneration, a disease that causes blindness. Read more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer Cramer Remix: These stocks are in a bull  market Cramer: Stop missing gains & start to  nail it Cramer: Cord-cutting fears could be  exaggerated  Third on the list was Under Armour, which Cramer considers to be  a technology company that sells clothing. He recommended buying  it on any pullback.  Wyndham Worldwide was also gettable, as the CEO transformed the  company from being a capital intensive builder of hotels to an  asset-light manager of hotels and timeshares. That new business  model allowed profits to rise.  Next up was United Rentals, which was a tough one. It had a  busted deal with a leveraged buyout that was not completed due to  financing issues. And with so much exposure to oil with the  equipment rental business, Cramer recognized that many wouldn't  have seen the gains coming.  Cramer was shocked to see CBS in eighth place, but perhaps it was  hidden in plain sight as it repeatedly calls itself America's  most watched network. An investor could have heard that and  bought the stock.Just looking at one's daily routine could have been a great clue for Starbucks. Sure, the stock had its ups and downs, but Cramer has found that the dips were always buying opportunities.""Recognizing that your own personal ritual is often shared by others can be one of the keys to successful investing, so the stock's 1,292 percent gain may have been the easiest to come by,"" Cramer said.  Other top performers were HanesBrands, Netflix, Extra Space, Priceline, Signet Jewelers, United Continental Holdings, and L Brands.  ""You can put almost all of your money in an index fund, and I  fully endorse that, but based on how obvious some of these  winners since the Haines bottom seven years ago have been, I think it  makes sense to sock away something extra to invest,"" Cramer said.

""We expect that much of the uncertainty will be resolved in the  relative short term, hopefully over the next few or so weeks,  when we expect the company to issue results, update guidance, and  file its 10-K,"" the investor said.

Added to last  year, when it lost 20.5 percent in a relatively flat year for markets,  the fund's declines are now greater than its 2014 gain.  Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which was Ackman's main loser in 2015,  was also to blame for this year's drop. Valeant's stock declined 16  percent from Feb. 17 through Tuesday amid questions over its earnings, providing the final bit of fuel for Ackman's fund to burn through  its gains.  Valeant, which has been part of Ackman's portfolio for only a  year, on Tuesday said it would restate earnings after having  prematurely accounted for some revenue, news which drove the  stock to pare recent losses.  Pershing Square Capital Management, which now oversees $12  billion, did not detail exactly what caused its most recent  losses and a spokesman declined to comment.  For investors who got in before the 2014 gains, Ackman's record  remains strong with his flagship Pershing Square International  fund still earning an average 12 percent a year over the last  decade.  ""Long term, Bill Ackman has still made a lot of people a lot of  money and they will likely stick with him, having known that a  ride with him can be pretty up and down,"" said one long-term  investor.  For clients who added money after 2014, helping Pershing Square's  portfolios grow to roughly $20 billion, the story could be more  nuanced.  Ackman, one of the industry's most prominent activist investors,  said in January that redemption requests had been modest late  last year when losses were already piling up.  So far, activist investors are performing roughly in line with  the average hedge fund, which lost an average 3 percent in the  last 12 months, data from Hedge Fund Research show. In the same  period, the broader stock market had bigger losses, with the  Standard & Poor's 500 index down nearly 9 percent.  Despite lackluster returns, investors continue to put money into  hedge funds, saying they are performing relatively better than  many other asset classes including stocks.  Renowned for his brash investing tactics and unwavering  self-confidence, Ackman adopted a new tone in his most recent  letter to clients, saying he entered the new year humbled and  having learned a number of hard lessons.  ""In 2016, we would like to generate results that reinforce the  confidence side of the equation. Humility and skepticism will  help get us there,"" he wrote.",https://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/25/ackmans-fund-erases-banner-gains-from-2014.html

"        Campaigners hail Apple shareholder move
			                 ",2015,12,24,"   Apple's decision to give long-term shareholders a greater say in  boardroom appointments is the most significant victory in an  almost decade-long push to improve corporate accountability in  the US, campaigners have said.  On Tuesday, the country's largest company amended its bylaws to  allow its investors to nominate directors, and shareholder rights  groups claimed the move would make it harder for other companies  to resist pressure to follow suit.  Apple's decision in favour of so-called proxy access — named  after the ballot paper, or proxy, that is sent to shareholders  ahead of annual meetings — takes to 129 the number of US  companies to have adopted the practice. In recent  weeks, Pfizer, AT&T and Wells Fargo have introduced  similar measures.  Scott Stringer, New York City comptroller, who has led a group of  public pension funds pushing for proxy access, called the Apple  decision a ""tipping point"".  He said: ""Corporate resistance to proxy access is crumbling as  more and more boards are coming to the table and working with  investors to provide greater accountability that will drive  long-term value.""  Patrick McGurn, special counsel at ISS, which advises investors  on corporate governance issues, said his organisation had advised  clients to support proxy access, as a means of tackling ""chronic  problems related to performance or governance"" when they arise at  companies. ""Companies like Apple tend to be bellwethers and other  boards are likely to look to such respected companies and are  likely to examine this issue now,"" Mr McGurn said.  But while many hailed the move, opponents warned that proxy  access could be used by special interest groups to push  political, social or environmental agendas unsupported by a  majority of shareholders.  Steve Balet of FTI Consulting, which defends companies against  activists, said the powers could be hijacked by shareholder  groups.  ""There is already a way for shareholders to nominate directors,  but it does require them to spend money, which in turn requires  them to believe that they will add value by doing so,"" he said.  ""Proxy access is a free pass for activism by special interest  groups.""  Apple's decision comes as the deadline approaches for  shareholders to submit proposals to next spring's annual  meetings, where campaigners are likely to unleash another round  of votes on the issue. More from the Financial Times:  In 2015, Mr Stringer's pension fund group targeted 75 companies  with governance records that it regarded as poor, winning  majority support for proxy access at more than half. It is yet to  announce its targets for 2016, but they are likely to focus on  energy companies.  The Securities and Exchange Commission repeatedly debated making  proxy access compulsory a decade ago, but the rule it eventually  proposed in 2009 was struck down two years later after a legal  challenge by the US Chamber of Commerce.  The proxy access rules being adopted voluntarily by companies  typically grant the right to nominate a quarter of the board to  shareholders who have, collectively, held at least 3 per cent of  the company for at least three years.  It remains unclear how often proxy access will be used and by  whom. Some large institutional shareholders regard it as an  emergency option, to be used only if a board is failing to hold  an underperforming management to account. Others, however, see a  more active role for long-term shareholders.  At present, shareholders who want to nominate their own directors  must launch an expensive proxy contest, complete with their own  separate ballot papers. Costs for administering such contests can  run to more than $10m, so they are typically only undertaken by  specialist activist hedge funds — such as Daniel Loeb's Third Point  or Bill Ackman's Pershing Square —  rather than longer-term shareholders.",https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/24/campaigners-hail-apple-shareholder-move.html
"        This Fidelity star is growing cautious about unicorns
			                 ",2015,12,01," Will Danoff, one of the U.S. mutual fund industry's best stock  pickers over the past 25 years, is tapping the brakes on funding  so-called unicorn companies, saying the prospects for fast  growing private businesses before they go public may be fading.Unicorns — start-ups valued at $1 billion or more — are making  front-page news around the globe, and that makes Danoff nervous.  He runs the $111 billion Contrafund for Boston-based Fidelity  Investments and his pre-IPO investments can lend an imprimatur of  legitimacy, given his track record of picking blue-chip winners.""There are so many unicorns. It means you have to be more careful  than we were three or four years ago,"" Danoff said in a telephone  interview with Reuters. ""Maybe we are at a point where it's going  to lose a bit of luster.""  Danoff, 55, is not a household name and lacks the swagger of  hedge fund managers such as Pershing Square's William Ackman or Third Point  Capital's Daniel Loeb. But through Contrafund, a  staple in U.S. 401(k) retirement plans, Danoff manages more money  than those two combined. And over the past 15 years, Danoff has  beaten the S&P 500 Index by 62 percent, with an annualized  total return of 8.12 percent versus the benchmark's 5 percent,  according to Morningstar Inc data.  Danoff's Contrafund has about $1.4 billion invested in pre-IPO  companies that include social media site Pinterest ($457  million), office space business WeWork Companies ($212 million),  and car service Uber Technologies ($193 million), for example.  It's the single largest portfolio of pre-IPO companies in the  U.S. mutual fund industry, according to industry fund  disclosures.  ""You need to find franchise companies, almost up there  with Google, Twitter and Facebook,"" Danoff said. ""These  phenomena are cyclical. You have confidence early in the cycle,  but you do investments with extreme caution later in the cycle.  I'm much more careful with my recent moves in the private  space.""  Over the past three years, the valuations of private companies  such as Uber, Xiaomi, Snapchat, Pinterest, Airbnb and Dropbox,  for example, have skyrocketed, as they prepare to become publicly  traded companies. Mutual funds such as Contrafund have become a  bigger player in an investing sector once dominated by venture  capital firms, boosting competition. Hot IPO  ""It's similar to a hot IPO,"" Danoff said, describing the  competition for getting a piece of the action in the private  rounds of funding for start-up companies.  However, Danoff said he may only get one shot in investing in a  unicorn before it goes public.  ""It's little more difficult to pass up (than an IPO) because  you're never sure if you get that second look,"" Danoff said. At  least with an IPO, you can buy the stock later if the price  drops. Danoff did that with Facebook Inc and now owns a stake  worth about $5 billion.  But in recent weeks, unicorn valuations have cooled off. Several  funds run by Fidelity, including Contrafund, have cut the  valuations of some big private companies, including Snapchat,  Zenefits and Delphix Corp. Individual portfolio managers don't  set valuations, which at Fidelity are done by a separate  investment committee. Contrafund doesn't own Snapchat, which the  committee devalued by 25 percent in October, but it does own  Delphix, which the committee cut by 43 percent.  Danoff said he feels good about the two dozen or so pre-IPO  companies in his portfolio. But even two years ago, when  Contrafund made a $159.4 million investment in Pinterest's Series  E funding round, Danoff admits to balking at the price.  ""I was like, 'My gosh, that's a high valuation,""' Danoff said.  But since then, the value of that Series E stake in Pinterest has  climbed nearly 150 percent, according to Contrafund disclosures.",https://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/01/fidelity-star-danoff-grows-cautious-about-unicorn-phenomenon.html

Hormel said it got  strong contributions from most of its segments, but did face  several headwinds including declining pork markets and the  outbreak of avian flu. Hormel did predict 2016 earnings of $2.85 to $2.95 per share, above the current Street consensus of $2.83. DSW — The shoe retailer beat estimates by  a penny with quarterly profit of 44 cents per share, but revenue  was short of Street forecasts.

Brocade  Communications — Brocade earned an adjusted 26  cents per share for its latest quarter, two cents above  estimates, with revenue also beating Street projections. However,  the networking hardware and software maker gave a weak current  quarter outlook, pointing in part to a moderating upgrade cycle. Xerox — Investor Carl Icahn has taken a 7.1 percent  stake in the company. Icahn said Xerox — best  known for copiers and printers — is undervalued and that he  may seek board seats. Last month, Xerox said it would begin a  review of its business and assess various options.

Soros  oversees the private fortune of investor and philanthropist  George Soros and his family.While Soros himself is no longer making investment calls, the  firm's involvement in Herbalife nonetheless drew battle lines  between the hedge fund industry's elder statesmen and one of its  new stars.Soros and Carl Icahn supported the nutrition and weight loss  company while Ackman has accused Herbalife of running a pyramid  scheme in which members are paid more for recruiting new members  than for selling the product. Herbalife denies the allegations.  Nearly a year ago, during the fourth quarter of 2014, Soros added  to its Herbalife position, owning 3.4 million shares at the end  of December. Fund managers are required tell the government what  they owned 45 days after the end of the quarter.  For Soros and other holders the bet on Herbalife has likely been  a profitable one with the shares having climbed 43 percent in the  last 52 weeks alone.  Balyasny Asset Management, Angelo Gordon & Co. and Partner  Fund Management have also exited their positions. AHL Partners  and Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo & Co. also exited their  positions, regulatory filings show.  Although the filings are backward looking and do not show what  funds own at this point, they are still widely watched as the  battle over the future of Herbalife heats up.  Ackman, who announced a $1 billion short position against the  company nearly three years ago and promised to take his bet ""to  the end of the earth,"" has lost money on this bet again this year  as the stock has climbed 46.5 percent since January.

			                 ",2015,10,21,"   Hedge fund manager Bill Ackman said Wednesday that he purchased an  additional 2 million shares of Valeant Pharmaceuticals as the stock  plunged following the release of an explosive note from Citron  Research that alleges the drugmaker is channel stuffing.  Ackman told CNBC that he believes in the company despite Citron  claims. His firm, Pershing Square, was already one of the largest  holders of Valeant stock.  Citron alleges that Valeant is using a network of specialty  mail-order pharmacies that the company actually controls to prop  up sales of its high-priced drugs and to keep patients and their  insurance companies from switching to less costly generics.   The report goes so far as to call Valeant the ""pharmaceutical  Enron.""  Valeant shares plummeted more than 39 percent before recovering  after a press release from the company denied the Citron report.  The stock eventually closed the day down about 19 percent. Read More Drug  prices: Which companies may be the next targets?  Citron's founder Andrew Left confirmed to CNBC that he is short  the stock, which is down more than 60 percent from a record high  hit in early August.  Left's report begins by referencing a Monday New York Times  story on the possible improper use of specialty pharmas by  drug companies. He then cites a report from investigative  journalist Roddy Boyd on his Southern Investigative Reporting  Foundation website questioning the exact nature of Valeant's  relationship with these pharmacies.  Citron claims that the specialty pharmaceutical companies in  question — Philidor RX and R&O Pharmacy — are  actually the same company with the same management. The short  selling firm presents as evidence patient privacy disclosure  forms from both companies that appear to be almost exact copies  except for a change in the company name. Both companies also  share the same privacy officer contact phone number, according to  Citron.  On Valeant's earnings call Monday, CEO J. Michael Pearson said  the company has a ""contractual relationship"" with Philidor and an  option to acquire Philidor ""if we so choose.""  Pearson also acknowledged that Valeant has contacted R&O  about providing payment for amounts it has received for Valeant  drugs.  ""We will refrain from comment on active litigation and look  forward to showing in court that we are owed the money,"" he said  on the call.  In his report, Citron's Left said:    ""While it is impossible for Citron to state for certain at this    point, this has the distinct aroma of product being jammed into    a channel. It had to have started small, and now it's just too    big. 'We have an option to purchase Philidor' is simply ...    trying to put the genie back in the bottle...Citron Research    has delivered the proof that something really stinks at Valeant    and it is goes beyond their egregious price hikes.""    Valeant called the report ""erroneous"" in a press release.   ""There is no sales benefit from any inventory held at these  specialty pharmacies and inventory held at the Philidor network  pharmacies is reflected in Valeant's reported inventory levels,""  said the release.  In an apparent effort to clarify confusion about the relationship  between Philidor and R&O, the company said in the release  that ""Philidor Rx Services is a pharmacy licensed in Pennsylvania  and also provides back-end services, including call center,  claims adjudication, IT and logistics support, as well as  compliance/HIPPA regulation guidance, to other pharmacies,  including R&O Pharmacy.""  The back-end service function would explain why phone numbers and  forms between Philidor and R&O are the same.  In a separate statement to CNBC, Valeant accused Citron of manipulating the market in an effort to drive down the company's share price.  Citron Research is a controversial, but often successful firm. It  is perhaps best known for its report on Longtop Financial  Technologies in April 2011, which questioned the veracity of the  company's financial statements. Citron was later validated by the  market as the shares were delisted and the SEC revoked the  company's registration. At the same time, Left has his own  checkered record, having once been disbarred for three years by  the National Futures Association.   Outrage about the practice of pharmaceutical firms increasing  prices on drugs exploded at the end of last month after a New  York Times report on little-known company Turing  Pharmaceuticals run by Martin Shkreli. This report was later  cited by presidential candidate Hillary Clinton as a reason to  look into this practice. Read More Drug Goes  From $13.50 a Tablet to $750, Overnight  Shares of the whole biotechnology sector have fallen since then  as a result of possible inquiries by the FDA and others into  pricing practices.   Allergan, whose shares also fell following the Citron report,  released a press release midday  saying it ""does not rely on specialty pharmacies for the  distribution of its products."" Allergan was not accused of any  wrongdoing in the short seller's report.  Valeant was subpoenaed by federal  prosecutors last week, in part because of its distribution  practices.   Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman is the third-largest  shareholder in Valeant through his firm Pershing Square Capital  Management, according to the most recent public filings.  Fran McGill, a spokesman for Pershing Square, declined to comment  on the Citron report. He would not say whether Pershing sold or  increased any of its stake in Valeant.

""Stocks are pretty cheap,"" Ackman told CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" a day after Tepper said  on the show that he's ""not as bullish"" as he could be on  U.S. equities.  ""Currency [fluctuations] have been largely reflected in next  year's [earnings] estimates,"" Ackman said. Read MoreDavid  Tepper: Good time to take money off the table  Caught up in the stock market turmoil on concerns about China's  slowing economy, Ackman's Pershing Square Capital, with $19  billion in assets under management, lost 9.2 percent last month,  erasing gains for the year.  ""Talk to anyone who knows anything about China [growth], they'll  tell you that 7 percent is fiction, 5 percent is probably a  fiction, and real growth in China is something like 1 percent to  4 percent,"" he said.  Last year, the Pershing Square boss was the top-performing hedge  fund with a return of more than 40 percent.  But Ackman said he's not sure how the rest of 2015 will shake out.  ""We're principally a long-only fund, with the exception  of Herbalife [short]. We own  concentrated positions in companies. We own them for years,"" he  said.  ""I can't tell you where any of our stocks are going to be next  month. I can't even tell you where they are going to be at the  end of the year,"" he continued. ""Mondelez will be a much more valuable  company a year from now than it is today. Two years from now,  it's going to be even more valuable.""  Last month, the activist investor disclosed a 7.5 percent stake  in snack and beverage giant Mondelez, worth about $5.5  billion at the time.  Shortly after that, Warren Buffett told CNBC a deal between  Mondelez and Kraft Heinz was unlikely in the near term. Mondelez  spun off from Kraft Foods in 2012.  Ackman said Friday that Mondelez could be a buyout candidate at  some point. ""If you had to make a list of companies that  Buffett would like to own, Mondelez is certainly on the list,"" he  said.  Hedge funder Nelson Peltz of Trian Partners was named to the Mondelez  board last year, after taking a stake.  Asked whether he'd seek a board seat, Ackman was cagey,  saying ""You never know.""  ""The company is working hard. And Nelson, I'm sure, is part of  it,"" he continued. ""We like things where there are lots of ways to  make money. One way to make money here is the company remains a  standalone business and gets to its potential and will do very,  very well.""  ""Either the current team will get the business to its potential  in a reasonablly rapid fashion or it will be a [takeover]  target,"" he added.  Ackman also talked about his well-publicized short  of Herbalife. He said it was not a bet only on what federal  regulators might do. ""I think that we have multiple regulators  here that understand there's a problem.""  ""The last way we win here is just basic business deterioration.  The company's business is declining double-digits in pretty much  every market around the world, except for China,"" he said.  In 2012, CNBC broke the news on Ackman's then-$1 billion  Herbalife short. He's campaigned ever since on his contention  that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme, an assertion the nutritional  supplement company has consistently denied.  ""If we're wrong, we fold up the tent and we move on,"" he said.  ""But as I've said from the very beginning on this one, and I  would say it's higher today, the certainty factor here is the  highest it can be for an investment.""  Herbalife was not immediately available to respond to CNBC's  request for comment.  In the pharma space, Pershing disclosed earlier this year a 4.9  percent stake in Canada-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals, a company he  had helped pursue Botox-maker Allergan.  Valeant did not end-up buying Allergan, which was eventually  bought by Actavis last year, in a $66  billion deal that netted Ackman $2.2 billion in paper  profits.  ""Every day you read about deals that don't happen."" Ackman said  Friday. ""It's very likely we'll partner with another strategic to  make a bid for a business.""  ""We may not get it,"" he continued. ""But if the outcome for  shareholders is the business either improves on its own or it  gets sold to someone else, I think that's a win.""Another Ackman holding, Canadian Pacific Railway, has fallen on hard  times this year on slumping oil prices, which caused a decline in  energy shipments and a recession in Canada.  But since Pershing started acquiring its activist position four  years ago in CP at $44 a share, the stock has surged to $145 as  of Thursday's close.  ""It's stronger. It's more profitable,"" Ackman told CNBC, sitting  next to the CEO he helped put in place to turn around the  railroad.  Canadian Pacific chief Hunter Harrison said, ""We're not  traders or investors, we're railroaders. And what we do ... is  try to provide the best service for the customer at the lowest  cost. Let the markets work out what the markets work out.""  ""I told you all a lot of things three years ago [and] nobody  believed me. We had a horrible reputation,"" he said. ""I think  we've proved people wrong.""  There's been speculation that CP might merge with U.S.-based CSX. That company's heir-apparent, Oscar Munoz, became CEO at United Continental this week, a job vacated by Jeff Smisek amid a probe into improprieties at the Port Authority  of New York and New Jersey.  Canadian Pacific COO Keith Creel, who also appeared with Ackman on ""Squawk Box,"" said he would not comment on speculation. ""Obviously there's  an opportunity there. But it's up to CSX to decide at this point  if they're aboard,"" said Creel, who's due to take over as CEO at CP in less than two years when Harrison  retires.

"        Mondelez to boost ad spending, healthier offerings
			                 ",2015,09,10,"   Snack maker Mondelez International will spend more on advertising its brands, increase healthier  offerings and expand its e-commerce business to boost sales as consumers  eat less processed food, an executive overseeing the company's growth  strategy said.Mark Clouse, Mondelez's chief growth officer, said in an  interview that the company plans to increase its advertising spending to 10  percent of revenue by 2018, up from 8 percent last year. The maker of Oreo cookies, Cadbury chocolate and Triscuit crackers also aims for  its e-commerce business to grow to $1 billion in 2020 from $100  million today.Additionally, Clouse said that in the next five years, Mondelez  hopes to generate half of its revenue from snacks perceived as  healthier, up from a third currently. This includes individually wrapped snacks  that are 200 calories or less and products that have nutritional  attributes, such as fewer ingredients and no artificial flavors.""If you look at where consumers are going, we have to better  position the portfolio to fully unlock the potential for growth,"" Clouse  said.   Since it became a stand-alone company in 2012, Mondelez has  mostly focused on improving its profit margins through reducing its  expenses. The company is in the midst of a plan to cut about $3 billion in  costs by the end of 2018 through measures such as opening more  efficient manufacturing plants and zero-based budgeting, which requires  expenses to be justified for each new period.   Until now, it hasn't given many details on how it plans to invest  those savings to achieve higher sales growth. Clouse said the approach involves changing existing products to suit consumer needs and  moving into new markets and categories that offer growth potential. In February, Mondelez said it was buying Enjoy Life Foods, the maker  of allergen free snacks, for an undisclosed amount.   The efforts come at a time when packaged food companies, faced  with sluggish growth, are increasingly under pressure from investors  to change their offerings and slash costs.In August, billionaire investor William Ackman's hedge fund  Pershing Square Capital Management disclosed that it spent $5.5 billion  for a 7.5 percent stake in Mondelez in what was seen by Wall Street as  an attempt to push the company to increase its margins further or potentially sell itself. Investors and analysts have speculated  that the company could combine with Kraft Heinz.   Kraft and Mondelez used to be the same company until their split  in 2012. Last March, Kraft said it was merging with ketchup-maker  H.J. Heinz in a deal backed by 3G Capital, a Brazilian private  equity firm known for cutting costs.Clouse said of 3G's abilities that ""there's no doubt that those  are our fundamental capabilities and skill sets that are really important  in today's world.""He added, ""The key is, can you bring the same operational  discipline and clarity to a growth agenda that allows you to sustain it over  time.

Ackman's $20 billion fund, Pershing Square Capital Management,  disclosed a 7.5 percent stake in Mondelez late Wednesday.  Illinois-based Mondelez is a heavyweight among global  packaged food makers with brands like Ritz and Cadbury.  In premarket trading Thursday, the stock was up more than 5 percent. (Click here  for the latest price.)   Sources familiar with Ackman's thinking told CNBC that private  equity firm 3G Capital, through its ownership of Kraft Heinz,  would be the most likely buyer should Ackman push Mondelez to  pursue an acquisition. However, there has been no indication that  Ackman has reached out to 3G.Read More  Mondelez CEO: Consumer cautious despite Q2 beat  The view is that Mondelez has meaningfully lower margins than 3G  has been able to produce at Heinz and what the market expects the  firm to be able to achieve with Kraft.   In 2012, Mondelez spun off its grocery business into Kraft Foods  Group, which merged with ketchup maker H.J. Heinz earlier this  year to form Kraft Heinz. Kraft Heinz is backed by Warren  Buffett's Berkshire  Hathaway and 3G.  It is unlikely that Kraft Heinz would be able to do a deal of  this scale in the next 18 months to two years because it only  recently completed its merger and still has fairly high debt,  said Alexia Howard, Sanford Bernstein & Co. senior  food research analyst.  ""It might be a little difficult to get something to happen in the  very near term. And the question is, over that next 18 months,  can Mondelez deliver performance to such a degree that they get  out ahead of where Kraft Heinz might be willing to go after  them?"" she told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday.  Mondelez has already begun to improve profit margins over the  last 18 months, and that progress has accelerated recently, Howard  said. She sees further room for improvement as the  company lowers plant costs, reduces its headcount and narrows its  product range.  Ackman believes Mondelez is a great business with products in the  right areas, no private label competition and a significant  presence in emerging markets, sources told CNBC.  Pershing Square said its beneficial ownership of 120.3 million  shares includes forward purchase contracts and call options.

The embattled nutrition and supplement company—a frequent  target of activist investor Bill Ackman—posted  second-quarter earnings of $1.24 per share on $1.16 billion in  revenue. Wall Street had expected Herbalife to report profit per  share of $1.11 on $1.14 billion in revenue, according to  consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters.  Shares of Herbalife surged as high as 8 percent in  extended-hours trading.   The company raised its guidance for the full year to a range  of $4.50 to $4.70, from $4.30 to $4.60.  ""The second quarter continued the improving trends we saw in the  previous quarter in terms of sales volumes and key sales leader  metrics, and we believe we will see these positive trends  continue through the second half of the year,"" said CEO Michael  Johnson in a release.   However, guidance for the third quarter includes a negative  impact from the stronger dollar of about 40 cents per diluted  share, the company said. Full-year guidance includes a currency  headwind of approximately $1.40 per diluted share. Most of that weakness comes from Venezuela, Herbalife said. The company has been under pressure recently regarding the  legality of its business practices and was contacted by federal  law enforcement agencies in April. In addition, the long-standing  feud with Ackman continues, as the high-profile investor heavily  shorts the stock.

Currently, 17 state and local  governments are using social impact bonds to target problems, according to the Rockefeller Foundation, which invested in the first social impact  bond in Peterborough, England.

States supposedly benefit from social impact bonds by  having an established, money-saving program, and the investors  get a return. Goldman Sachs has provided a part of the funding for four  social impact projects, including the largest social impact bond  ever in 2014, which totaled $27  million.  Goldman Sachs said it was not able to comment by press time in response to a request from CNBC. Bank of America Merrill Lynch partnered with Social Finance  to raise capital for a $13.5 million program in New York state to  reduce recidivism in 2013.   Liam O'Neil, head of the markets group at Merrill Lynch, said  money for the New York project came from groups like  the Robin Hood Foundation,  the Rockefeller  Foundation and philanthropies  associated with some big names: Larry Summers,  Bill Ackman, Jim Sorenson and more.  Within the year, Bank of America Merrill  Lynch is hoping to fund two new social  impact bonds dealing with veterans and health care, he said. ""What we're trying to do is bridge the gap between  investing and philanthropy to create a vehicle for  investors to fund important social  causes,"" O'Neil said.  Federally, the 2016 budget  established a Pay for Success Incentive Fund endowed with  $300 million over the next 10 years. Presidential hopeful Hillary  Clinton endorsed social impact bonds in  2013. But despite all those shows of support, some argue there  are reasons to be critical of the new financial tool.  The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,  the largest national union for public service  providers, with 1.6  million nurses, corrections officers and  sanitation workers among others as  members, passed a resolution in 2014 against  social impact bonds. According to the resolution, ""Tying high stakes to  outcome-based performance measures may motivate investors to game  the system to avoid losing money, including not serving the  neediest populations, focusing on selected outcomes at the  expense of other aspects of a program, or rigging the  rules."" In 2013, a study by  the Department of Legislative Services in Maryland looked at the  state's social impact bond program for reducing recidivism, and  concluded that the complexity of arranging all of the moving  parts was more costly to the state than what it saved. ""The additional costs of a SIB program cannot be justified  by offsetting savings. Other potential benefits do not justify  the cost or complexity of a SIB program either,"" the study's  summary said.

""It not only reduces remedial education, it reduces crime,  it reduces unemployment down the road,"" she said. Social impact bonds have significant potential in the right  circumstances, Gustafsson-Wright said. ""What this really is about is getting governments and  service providers to focus on outcomes, and getting governments  to focus on preventative services,"" she said.

Goldman Sachs said it was not able to comment by press time in response to a request from CNBC. Bank of America Merrill Lynch partnered with Social Finance  to raise capital for a $13.5 million program in New York state to  reduce recidivism in 2013.   Liam O'Neil, head of the markets group at Merrill Lynch, said  money for the New York project came from groups like  the Robin Hood Foundation,  the Rockefeller  Foundation and philanthropies  associated with some big names: Larry Summers,  Bill Ackman, Jim Sorenson and more.  Within the year, Bank of America Merrill  Lynch is hoping to fund two new social  impact bonds dealing with veterans and health care, he said. ""What we're trying to do is bridge the gap between  investing and philanthropy to create a vehicle for  investors to fund important social  causes,"" O'Neil said.  Federally, the 2016 budget  established a Pay for Success Incentive Fund endowed with  $300 million over the next 10 years. Presidential hopeful Hillary  Clinton endorsed social impact bonds in  2013. But despite all those shows of support, some argue there  are reasons to be critical of the new financial tool.  The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,  the largest national union for public service  providers, with 1.6  million nurses, corrections officers and  sanitation workers among others as  members, passed a resolution in 2014 against  social impact bonds. According to the resolution, ""Tying high stakes to  outcome-based performance measures may motivate investors to game  the system to avoid losing money, including not serving the  neediest populations, focusing on selected outcomes at the  expense of other aspects of a program, or rigging the  rules."" In 2013, a study by  the Department of Legislative Services in Maryland looked at the  state's social impact bond program for reducing recidivism, and  concluded that the complexity of arranging all of the moving  parts was more costly to the state than what it saved. ""The additional costs of a SIB program cannot be justified  by offsetting savings. Other potential benefits do not justify  the cost or complexity of a SIB program either,"" the study's  summary said. Read MoreSocial impact  investing: Making money by making a difference Emily Gustafsson-Wright, a fellow at the Brookings  Institution, who has researched social impact bonds extensively,  said the benefits are more long term. In the case of pre-kindergarten education, she said the  savings for the government are probably much bigger than what  they're calculating now. ""It not only reduces remedial education, it reduces crime,  it reduces unemployment down the road,"" she said. Social impact bonds have significant potential in the right  circumstances, Gustafsson-Wright said. ""What this really is about is getting governments and  service providers to focus on outcomes, and getting governments  to focus on preventative services,"" she said.  ""It's a lot less risky than business as usual for  governments. Billions are spent on social services that we don't  know what the outcomes are.""Pennsylvania state Rep. Mike  Schlossberg, who worked closely on the state  proposal, said he is hoping to fund early education through  social impact bonds in his home district.  He said he sees it as a chance to improve future outcomes for kids and save money.  ""They're going to wind up being much more productive citizens  over the course of their career,"" he said. ""We invest a little  now, save a ton of money down the line.""Schlossberg said there are challenges in the  coordination, but that he supports pay-for-success  contracts. ""It is a highly complex process,"" he said, adding that ""a  pay-for-success program works when you have enough data to  unquestionably prove that throwing money at a problem will  improve that problem."" Schlossberg, a Democrat, said both parties can get behind using social  impact bonds to fund projects.""Democrats sometimes have a tendency to talk about spending, and  Republicans have a tendency talk about cutting, but this is a  way.""

President Barack Obama called the group  ""society's lottery winners"" last  week, noting that the top 25 earning hedge fund managers made  more in 2014 ($11.6 billion) than the roughly 158,000  kindergarten teachers in the U.S. did combined ($8.5 billion).  Presidential hopeful Hillary  Clinton cited the same statistic in joining Obama's call for ending carried interest tax treatment, echoing what she said in her first campaign speech:  there's ""something wrong"" when  ""hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than nurses or the  truckers.""  It's not just politicians attacking investment managers. The American  Federation of Teachers' president, Randi Weingarten, cited the  kindergarten comparison in speeches this month, for example, and  a group called the Hedge Clippers have targeted New York-area billionaires like  Paul Singer, Bill Ackman and  Paul Tudor Jones. They  argue that the investors are hurting the poor through some  investments and political donations, protesting this year at industry events and near the managers' homes and offices.   All that makes some hedge fund managers fume. (Tweet this)  One prominent investor—who, like others, asked to remain anonymous given  the divisive subject—called the rhetoric ""class warfare"" and  noted other times in history, including before World War II, when  financial speculators were unfairly blamed by politicians.

Heck, just look at the airlines flying high right now!  Yet again on Thursday, both the  and Dow  Jones ended in the red when the price of crude oil collapsed  to $43. At this point, Cramer has stated the benefits to low oil  prices so many times he's turning blue in the face.  ""With commodity prices down and down big, as they are now, that  gives you a benign market, a positive one, less roiled by a host  of earnings disappointments and interest rate hikes that can slay  any bull, even a raging one,"" the ""Mad Money"" host added.  Cramer saw the same thing occur back in 2008, and while it is  painfully clear that commodity spikes contributed to the two  largest market crashes of his lifetime; for some reason people  still question if cheap oil prices are a good thing.  The ""Mad Money"" host has exhausted himself talking about the  benefits. How small businesses and investors now have expendable  income to go out to dinner, or hire more. Even the airline industry has made a major comeback because of crude.""Guess what key leadership group is back again? The airlines where I like Southwest, Spirit and American Airlines in that order,"" Cramer said. Read More Cramer: We've got the  market all wrong  Cramer has always had the goal of alerting investors when an  incredible opportunity reveals itself. He knows how to spot the  stocks that keep heading higher without any end in sight.  For instance, the $2.3 billion drug developer Esperion Therapeutics has been on a  tear lately as investors anticipate its pill that is designed to  lower levels of bad cholesterol in patients who are unable to  take traditional statins.  Could this stock head even higher in 2015? To find out, Cramer  spoke with Esperion CEO Tim Mayleben.  ""I don't know the explanation for the stock activity for sure,  but we are very excited about the drug that we are developing.  It's got a particularly unsexy name…but we think it's one of  the most attractive drugs in development,"" Mayleben said. Read MoreCramer: Snap up this incredible  opportunity  Now that the  Fed meeting is over, Cramer can finally breathe easier.  However amid a volatile market on Thursday that ended in the red,  could the  bounce back?  To find out where the S&P could be headed Cramer went off the  charts to speak to Carley Garner, a technician and co-founder  of DeCarley Trading and colleague of Cramer's  at RealMoney.com.  Garner indicated that while the S&P has suffered weakness  recently, this is only a temporary stop on its way back up. She  thinks that the market is not overbought or oversold, it's right  in the middle.  Thus Garner believes that the S&P will head higher, all the  way up to 2170 or 2180. At that point, she recommends doing some  profit taking. Read More Cramer: S&P headed  higher? Here's when to worry  Cramer has had his eye on technology this year and sometimes in  order to stay ahead of the trends that means going off the tape  to talk to innovative companies.  On Wednesday, Starbucks announced plans to roll out an  on-demand delivery service through its mobile app. The delivery  service was made possible thanks to a partnership with Postmates,  which allows you to order anything from any store and they will  deliver it to you under an hour for a small fee.  Last year Postmates was only in five cities, and now they have  grown into 22 markets across the U.S. with the goal of 50 by the  end of the year.  Will the deal with Starbucks take Postmates to another level? To  find out, Cramer spoke with its co-founder and CEO Bastian  Lehmann.  ""Starbucks and Postmates…Wow! We are crazy in the office  still. It was such a big day yesterday and we have been working  on this for months but to be able to talk about it, and the trust  we received from Starbucks is incredible for us,"" Lehmann said.  Another company on Cramer's radar is Platform Specialty Products Corp. In 2013 it was started  by Martin Franklin, the founder of Jarden. He started the venture with the backing of  activist Bill Ackman, whose  Pershing Square fund owns more  than 20 percent.  Since that time Platform has made a series of chemical company  acquisitions, with the most recent large deal to acquire Arysta  Lifescience for approximately $3.51 billion. Even the stock is up  54 percent since it listed on the NYSE with a 16 percent rally  year to date.   With all of its acquisitions and equity offerings, has Platform  raised all of the cash it needs? To find out, Cramer sat down  with Platform Specialty Products CEO Dan Leever.  ""We have all the money we need right now, but the next big deal  that we do will require raising more equity for sure,"" Leever  said.  In the Lightning Round, Cramer gave his take on a few caller  favorite stocks: Biocryst Pharmaceuticals: ""I'm not  going to go with that one, because that's been knocking around  for a long time with enzyme specialty pharma. It doesn't have  what I want, which are these big phase three drugs that are about  to go on the market."" Duke Energy Corp: ""All the  utilities have been slammed here over the false fears that the  Fed is going to instantly start raising rates. I'm going to say  that I like Duke, but I see you and raise you with Dominion.""Read More  Lightning Round: Slammed over false Fed fears",https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/19/cramer-remix-these-stocks-are-soaring-again.html

"        Bill Ackman: I haven't traded around Herbalife short
			                 ",2015,03,13,"   Activist investor Bill  Ackman told CNBC on Friday he has not traded around his  short position in Herbalife.  ""We're not trying to make money on short-term moves in Herbalife  stock,"" he said in a ""Squawk Box""  interview, a day after The Wall Street  Journal reported that federal prosecutors and the FBI  are investigating potential stock manipulation in regards to  Herbalife. According to  the Journal, government officials have  interviewed people hired by Ackman's $18 billion Pershing Square  Capital Management hedge fund.   ""Anyone at the government is welcome to look at how we traded  this,"" Ackman said.  He said he knows nothing more about the investigation than what  he read in the paper, adding that he has not been contacted  directly by the FBI or the Justice Department regarding the  matter.   ""We've hired a political consultant, a firm called Global  Strategy Group. They in turn hire subcontractors around the  country and they assisted us in ... advocating on behalf of our  very firmly held view that Herbalife is a pyramid scheme,"" he  said. ""And my understanding is ... a handful of the people that  they've hired or that work for them have been interviewed by the  FBI."" Read MoreAckman 'borderline manipulative' on  Herbalife: Expert  Ackman first shorted the nutritional supplement and weight-loss company on May 1, 2012. When he went  public with his position in December 2012, the hedge fund manager  called the company a pyramid scheme and said his position was  worth $1 billion. The company has strongly denied Ackman's  charges ever since.  In Friday's CNBC interview, he described his position in  Herbalife. ""We basically held a large short position in the  company that we started in December of 2012 and we've held it up  to the stock price rise."" He said he changed the form of the  position by early 2014 ""because we were getting  squeezed by Mr. Icahn and others.""  Fellow billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn, who famously had  a war of words with Ackman on CNBC in 2013, took the other side  of Herbalife trade. But last year, the two hugged it out and put  aside their past differences at the CNBC-Institutional  Investor Delivering Alpha Conference. Read MoreFlashback: Ackman says Herbalife is  like Bernie Madoff  ""So we covered a bunch of the short, as I've said publicly, and  we bought relatively long-dated puts,"" Ackman said Friday. ""What  we've done since then is simply rolled those puts and kept on  approximately the same size investment.""  He said he's spent ""something less than $50 million"" on his  campaign against Herbalife. ""The vast majority of that is  actually legal fees, and second investigative costs.""  Herbalife is a multilevel marketing company that sell  products through a network of distributors, many of whom work at  home and get paid by selling products, as well as recruiting  other distributors. Supporters, including some Latino  community leaders, say Herbalife has provided its  salespeople with economic opportunity and health benefits.

Herbalife released a statement to CNBC Thursday night: ""Mr.  Ackman has a $1 billion bet against Herbalife and a direct  financial interest in hurting our company. ...

"        Ackman's Herbalife talk not quite manipulation: Expert
			                 ",2015,03,13,"  Bill Ackman's comments about  nutritional supplement company Herbalife do not appear to add up to market  manipulation, former federal prosecutor Jacob Frenkel said  Friday.  ""In terms of what he has said so far, it may be borderline  manipulative, but it does not yet appear to be stock manipulation  because a lot of the statements he's making are general  statements, but they are conclusory,"" Frenkel said in an  interview on CNBC's ""Squawk  Box."" Read MoreBill Ackman: I haven't traded around  Herbalife short  The FBI and federal prosecutors are investigating whether  Herbalife's stock has been manipulated, The Wall Street  Journal reported Thursday.   Sources told the publication the authorities have interviewed  people connected to Ackman, who shorted Herbalife's stock and  waged a public battle with the company over the course of more  than two years, alleging the nutritional supplement distributor  is a pyramid scheme and insisting the stock price will go to  zero.  ""I'm puzzled by the story. We have not heard from the FBI or  Department of Justice,"" Ackman told CNBC. ""If they have any  questions for me I'm happy to answer them. I stand by every  statement I've made about Herbalife. The company has never  identified anything we've said that is false.""  Ackman took a short position against Herbalife in May 2012, and  went public with it the following December.  What followed was a contentious period during which Ackman came  under fire from Herbalife and other well-known investors,  including Third Point founder Dan Loeb and billionaire  investor Carl Icahn. Ackman aggressively defended his  position—including during an on-air battle with Icahn during  CNBC's ""Fast Money: Halftime  Report.""   In February, the Pershing Square Capital Management founder told  CNBC he was through with disclosing his short positions to the  public.  Read MoreAckman: After Herbalife, I'm done with  'public shorts'  Frenkel said Ackman's campaign against Herbalife was notable for  its highly public profile.  The real quality short sellers do a lot of this work behind the  scenes,"" he said. ""They're trying to get their message to the  government to understand their analysis to understand why the  company is not as strong as the company wants the public to  believe.""  In March 2014, Herbalife announced that the Federal Trade  Commission had opened an investigation into its business model.  It is not terribly likely that continuing to build on short  positions can be considered manipulative because the government  does not disclose the progress of its investigation to the short  sellers or those working on their behalf, said Frenkel, a partner  at law firm Shulman Rogers.  ""What they're looking at is whether there was any materially  false or misleading information that was being given to the  government for the purpose of helping to drive the stock, because  there's clearly pecuniary interest,"" Frenkel said. Read MoreFeds interview Ackman allies over  Herbalife: DJ  Ron Geffner, former SEC enforcement attorney, told ""Squawk Box""  the case is likely going nowhere and represents the cost of doing  business for Pershing Square.  He said that Ackman would likely avoid any possible charges of  stock manipulation so long as investigators determined he  genuinely believed his comments on Herbalife were true. It would  be challenging for prosecutors to find a ""smoking gun"" that  proves Ackman or his associates had no fundamental belief behind  the research or statements they released publicly or presented to  regulators, he added.  Authorities will also seek to determine whether a group of people  acted in concert to drive down the price of Herbalife's stock, he  said.  Herbalife also weighed in on the investigation on Thursday,  saying in a statement, ""Mr. Ackman has a $1 billion bet against  Herbalife, and a direct financial interest in hurting our  company. For more than two years, he has spent over $75 million  orchestrating a false and fabricated attack against Herbalife,  all in an effort to enrich himself,""  —CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin contributed to this  report.",https://www.cnbc.com/2015/03/13/ackmans-herbalife-comments-are-borderline-manipulative-expert.html

Analysts had expected Herbalife to report earnings of  about $1.22 a share on $1.16 billion in revenue, according to a  consensus estimate from Thomson Reuters.

"        Bill Ackman: Herbalife short was 'philanthropic'
			                 ",2015,01,14,"   Bill Ackman, the activist investor famous for his high-profile battle with Herbalife,  claimed his short position on the stock was ""the most  philanthropic investment I have ever made"" on CNBC  Wednesday. Ackman and his investment company, Pershing Square Capital Management, shot to prominence when it shorted the vitamin  supplement company. Ackman has been in a high-profile battle with  its management since 2012, when he made his $1 billion short  position public and accused management of running a pyramid  scheme. Investors initially shrugged off his claims, which are being investigated by the U.S.'s Federal Trade Commission, and the stock rose, boosted by support from fellow activist investor Carl Icahn. The company and Icahn have long disputed Ackman's claims. However, Herbalife's share price has sunk recently, and Ackman said he is ""in the money today"" on the high-profile bet.  ""We're slightly ahead of the game, but it's not really a game,  this is serious business. We think this company is breaking the  law,""  he told CNBC. ""Carl Icahn is a fairly incredible guy. I hope at age 78 I  have as much energy and spirit as he has,"" he added, of his rival  in the Herbalife battle.  Ackman did not rule out another big public short, but conceded he  would ""think very hard before we do another."" He confirmed that  Pershing currently had a short as a hedge on one of its  investments, but declined to comment on which one.  Ackman listed Pershing Square Holdings on Amsterdam's Euronext  exchange in October. This has heightened speculation that a European company may be  next on Pershing's list.  ""It's something that I would put on the list for years from  now,"" Ackman said.Ackman also engaged in a high-profile battle over the  future of Botox manufacturer Allergan last year. Together with  Valeant Pharmaceuticals, he tried to take over the company, but  was ultimately thwarted by a takeover bid from Actavis. The  subsequent share price bump led to an estimated profit of $2.2  billion for Ackman's fund Pershing Square Capital  Management.A recent picture taken of Ackman at his desk by Bloomberg  showed a list of names which has sparked rumors about his future  investments - including Juan Ramon Alaix of Zoetis, Paul Fribourg, chief executive of Continental Grain, and Warren Buffett's former business manager David Sokol. Ackman is one of the best-known faces of a new breed of activist  investor, which have sprung up in recent years to worry  boardrooms. Most recent activity has focused on the U.S., where  the business climate, which allows shareholder proposals, has  always been more suited to activist investing. There has been  some speculation that Europe, with a host of companies that  analysts argue are undervalued, might be ripe for more  activism.

"        Bill Ackman: Herbalife is like Bernie Madoff
			                 ",2015,01,07,"   Activist investor Bill  Ackman renewed his attack on Herbalife during a CNBC interview Wednesday,  likening the nutrition and weight management company to Bernie  Madoff.  ""Herbalife, we're doing God's work,"" he added.  ""When you shine sunlight on Madoff it makes it difficult  for Madoff to find victims. The same thing is happening at  Herbalife,"" the founder of the $18 billion Pershing Square  Capital Management hedge fund said on ""Squawk Box"" as the show debuted in its new home in  New York City.  Ackman first shorted Herbalife on May 1, 2012. When he went  public with his position in December 2012, the hedge fund manager  called the company a ""pyramid scheme"" and said his position was  worth $1 billion. The company has strongly denied Ackman's  charges ever since.

That's on top of a 50 percent loss for all of  2014. The stock has been moving lower recently, Ackman said,  because the company is going to miss earnings and will have to  redo its guidance. He said there's a massive seller  in the market and that can be seen by looking at short-term  option trading.  Ackman also claimed: ""You have a flight of top [Herbalife]  distributors, senior employees from around the world, contacting  us, contacting the government, sharing information.""For Herbalife's part, the company released a statement to CNBC: ""Bill Ackman is entirely predictable—with his Herbalife put  options expiring next week, he is off on yet another tirade of  misrepresentations, the sole purpose of which is to drive down our  share price. The facts about our business are inconvenient  for Mr. Ackman, and he clearly has no interest in learning them,  as evidenced by his team's last-minute cancellation of a  meeting last month that he requested.""  Activist investor Carl Icahn, who famously had a war of words  with Ackman on CNBC in 2013, took the other side of Herbalife  trade and has been feeling the heat. The two hugged it out and  put aside their past differences  at this year's CNBC-Institutional Investor Delivering  Alpha Conference.  Billionaire George Soros is also hurting on Herbalife's slide,  and the chief architect of Soros Fund Management's bullish bet on  the company has quietly  departed the investment shop. Soros has been cutting his  Herbalife stake.  Separately, Ackman—who joined Valeant in April in the pharmaceutical  company's pursuit of Allergan—said Wednesday Valeant could have  had the Botox maker if it had raised its bid.  He added, however, that Actavis—which ultimately agreed to acquire Allergan  in a deal valued at $66 billion—will become a greater  company with the addition. ""It's going to become an incredibly  dominate, fast-growing, most efficient, R&D investing  company.""  Ackman's bet on Allergan netted about $2.2 billion—a big  winner for Pershing whose main fund returned 40 percent in  2014, nearly four times last year's gain in the .

"        Ackman has the luck of a loser, to the tune of $2.2B
			                 ",2014,11,18,"   Heads he wins. Tails he wins.  That was the situation William A.  Ackman, the hedge fund manager and founder of Pershing Square  Capital Management, found himself in — or perhaps more  accurately, orchestrated — on Monday.His investment partner, Valeant  Pharmaceuticals International, appeared to withdraw from a  hostile takeover battle to buy Allergan, the maker of Botox, when a higher rival offer  emerged. Normally, Mr. Ackman and Valeant would be considered the  losers, having been unable to complete the deal that they set out  to clinch months ago. Read MoreWhy a Santa rally might not be in the  cards However, Mr. Ackman and, to a lesser extent, Valeant found  a backdoor way to win: Having acquired 9.7 percent of Allergan's  stock before they made their takeover bid — which put the  company in play — Mr. Ackman's fund now stands to collect  $2.6 billion. He will share 15 percent of the profits with  Valeant, or $389 million, leaving him with a tidy profit of $2.2  billion. In deal parlance, the tactic that led Mr. Ackman to his  latest multibillion-dollar windfall is called a ""toehold,"" in  which a suitor takes a position in a stock before starting a  takeover bid.The ""toehold"" is hardly new. It was used routinely by  corporate raiders in the 1980s. David Fox, a partner at Kirkland  & Ellis, wrote in a memo to clients that toeholds were used  ""by a potential bidder to convey its serious intent or, if  necessary, as a platform to quietly or publicly put the target in  play."" But their use slowed considerably as hostile bids fell out  of favor. More from The New  York Times:Justice Is Weighing Civil Suit Against Angelo  Mozilo Oil Services Giants Agree to Friendly  Merger One Day, Two Deals and a Changed Calculus of  Deal-Making The new twist on the toehold is the idea of a company  teaming up with an activist. The benefits are manifold: The  activist brings financing, ""a large megaphone"" and a skill set  ""in covert accumulations,"" according to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  & Katz, the law firm that specializes in mergers and  acquisitions and objects to the practice. Given Mr. Ackman's success, bankers and lawyers are  anticipating a flood of similar takeover proposals. Some big  companies are quietly contemplating teaming up with activist  investors when only months ago such cooperation would have been  considered an unholy alliance. The question is whether this phenomenon should be a welcome  part of the latest mergers-and-acquisitions frenzy or whether the  toehold maneuver, as reconceived by Mr. Ackman, should be  considered just the latest form of market rigging. Read MoreMega-mergers arepopular again on Wall  Street   Judging solely by the outcome, it is hard to fault Mr. Ackman and  his toehold play. Allergan agreed to be sold for $219 a share, 48  percent more than the price less than six months ago. The buyer,  Actavis, is probably the right  acquirer, unlike Valeant, which had been expected to decimate  Allergan's research and development budget. The Allergan-Actavis deal would never have been possible  without Mr. Ackman and Valeant showing up at the table first. And  it is hard to believe that Mr. Ackman or Valeant would have had  leverage with Allergan had they not found a way to control nearly  10 percent of its stock. Putting Allergan into play effectively  created about $20 billion of value almost out of thin  air. So if the goal of the markets is for shareholders to be  rewarded with the highest price possible, Mr. Ackman clearly  succeeded. But there are other, perhaps more nuanced, views about  how to define success. Mr. Ackman's tactic worked this time. But what happens if a  company falls into the wrong hands and at a much lower price as a  result of pressure from the one-two punch of a large corporation  teamed with an activist? Is that the price of shareholder  democracy? Read More And then there's the question of conflicts — and even  legality. Mr. Ackman's coalition with Valeant raised questions about  whether such an alliance violated insider trading laws. At  minimum, it leaves investors with a questionable taste in their  mouths about fairness of the markets, given the special access  certain investors — like Mr. Ackman — were able to  secure by gaining advance information about a potential  transaction. Wachtell, Lipton, which defended Allergan against the  hostile bid, described the maneuver as ""crafty"" and ""one in which  the strategic bidder cannot lose and the activist greatly  increases its odds of catalyzing a quick profit-yielding event,  investing and striking deals on both sides of a transaction in  advance of a public announcement."" Allergan sued Mr. Ackman and Valeant, contending that their  bid was illegal. The case is still pending, but unfortunately may  never be decided because it will most likely be withdrawn,  leaving other companies and investors to continue to try to test  the legal limits of the courts until a definitive ruling is  made. Read MorePrivate equity bets on  'revolution'—in oil and gas In the end, Mr. Ackman turned out to be right this time.  But it wasn't always obvious. Early on, Mr. Ackman, frustrated  that Allergan wasn't willing to negotiate, attacked the integrity  of Allergan's chief executive, David E. I. Pyott. ""Allergan shareholders have also received the strong  impression from Mr. Pyott that he intends to take a 'scorched  earth' approach to a potential transaction with Valeant,"" Mr.  Ackman wrote. He contended that Mr. Pyott ""appears to be  motivated more by personal animus than by what is in the best  interest of Allergan shareholders."" Mr. Ackman was wrong about that.

"        Mega-mergers are popular again on Wall Street
			                 ",2014,11,18,"   Stocks are surging, corporate executives are ambitious and debt  is cheap. The result is one of the biggest booms ever in mergers  and acquisitions. Mergers worth $100 billion, made on Monday, put Wall Street  on pace for a year of deal-making rivaling those during the  dot-com bubble and the private equity upsurge just before the  financial crisis.  The announcement of two more mega-deals — the $66  billion acquisition of the Botox-maker Allergan by Actavis, and  the $34.6 billion takeover of the oil field services firm Baker  Hughes by a bigger rival, Halliburton — made Monday a  symbolic tipping point. Read MoreWhy aSanta rally might not be in the cards With those transactions on the books, about $1.5 trillion  in deals targeting American companies have been announced this  year, the most since 2000, according to Thomson Reuters, the  financial information company. Five years after the end of the financial crisis that  reshaped the economy, it appears that big companies are finally  willing to make big bets again, especially in the health care,  technology and media industries. The conditions are ideal, with  borrowing costs low and share prices rising. And chief executives  are no longer worried about a double-dip recession or another  eurozone crisis. Instead, they are betting on growth in the years  ahead. ""The fact that we're getting all these deals suggests that  C.E.O.s are feeling pretty good about things,"" said Mark Zandi,  chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""It reflects the economy,  and it also portends better times ahead. Deals don't get done  unless people feel pretty good about the future.""  Global deal-making in 2014 has topped the $3 trillion mark in a  year for only the fifth time and is up 50 percent from the same  time a year ago, while acquisitions targeting American companies  are up 65 percent, according to Thomson Reuters. More from The New York  Times:Justice Is Weighing Civil Suit Against Angelo  Mozilo Oil Services Giants Agree to Friendly  Merger One Day, Two Deals and a Changed Calculus  of Deal-Making Yet there are some dark corners in the dazzling successes  of Wall Street's deal makers. Even as companies spend on mergers  and acquisitions, they are not spending in other areas. Wage  growth remains sluggish, and hiring is growing only  modestly. Moreover, whether or not mergers and acquisitions are even  a positive for the economy — and for the companies striking  them — remains a subject of debate. Mergers also often  create redundancies, which can lead to job cuts. ""There is some evidence that deals may actually be  detrimental to the economy, particularly these big bursts,"" said  Tara M. Sinclair, an associate professor of economics at George  Washington University. ""Economists are pretty divided as to  whether they're a good thing or a bad thing.""  Regulatory hurdles also threaten to complicate some of the most  audacious mergers. Comcast's  proposed $45 billion takeover of Time  Warner Cable remains under scrutiny by antitrust officials in  Washington, who are examining whether the combination will hurt  consumers. (Disclosure: Comcast is the owner of  NBCUniversal, the parent company of CNBC and  CNBC.com.)  In another instance, SoftBank, the Japanese firm that owns  the wireless provider Sprint, backed away from a planned  acquisition of T-Mobile USA after it became convinced that the  deal would not pass muster with antitrust regulators. And  Halliburton's deal for Baker Hughes could also draw a close  look. Read More ""The thing I've been anxious about all year is that some  regulatory activity blocks one of these deals, and then the  M.&A. recovery slows down,"" said Gregg R. Lemkau, global  co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Goldman Sachs. ""No C.E.O.  wants to do a 'bet the company deal' and not get it done, and  regulatory scrutiny could be a roadblock to this  continuing.""  Already, the Obama administration effectively scuttled one  mega-deal. After a flurry of so-called inversions, in which  American companies bought overseas competitors and moved their  headquarters abroad to reduce their tax bills, the Treasury  Department in September announced rules targeting the  transactions.  Weeks later, AbbVie, a drug maker based near Chicago,  walked away from a $54 billion agreement to acquire its Irish  rival Shire. Other inversions in the works were put off, and few  such deals have been announced in recent months. Nonetheless, the size and variety of deals being tried  reflect a new sense of ambition among many of the world's biggest  companies. ""There is a frenzy for M.&A. that is driven in part by  the low cost and accessibility of capital, and the need for  consolidation in many industries,"" said Brent Saunders, chief  executive of Actavis, which on Monday struck the biggest deal of  the year.  Many of the larger deals have been driven by sweeping  changes that are shaking up entire industries. Drug makers like   and Actavis are on the hunt for new products to fill in  gaps in their offerings. The health care industry is responsible  for much of the surge in deal-making this year, producing $423.6  billion in announced deals, or nearly double the next-busiest  year.  Telecommunications firms sought to bolster their footprints  across the country and gain more negotiating power with content  providers. Comcast's agreement to buy Time Warner Cable was  followed by AT&T's agreement to buy DirecTV for $48.5  billion. Even media giants like 21st Century Fox, run by Rupert  Murdoch, looked to deal making, in part to give them more clout  to use against distributors.  And companies like social networks and cigarette makers  also got involved. Reynolds American is seeking to buy a rival  tobacco company, Lorillard, for $27.4 billion, and Facebook  acquired WhatsApp for $21.8 billion. Read MorePrivate equity bets on  'revolution'—in oil and gas  Facebook, like many other big companies, paid for its  acquisitions largely with its own stock, which has risen along  with the broader market this year. Those companies that needed to  borrow billions to pay for costly acquisitions were emboldened by  interest rates, which remain near record lows and show no signs  of rising soon.  Another factor fueling deal making this year has been the  presence of activist hedge funds. William A. Ackman's hedge fund  Pershing Square Capital Management had been working with another  company, Valeant, in an effort to buy Allergan, putting the Botox  maker in play for its eventual sale to Actavis. And Carl C. Icahn  has successfully agitated for the sale of a number of companies,  including Family Dollar. The previous two merger booms preceded sharp economic  downturns. The dot-com bubble burst in 2001, and the leveraged  buyout surge was scuttled by the financial crisis. But this time,  bankers are not bracing for another downturn. ""The buildup here has been more disciplined, longer and  more methodical, which hopefully means that it will continue,""  said Blair W. Effron, co-founder of Centerview Partners, an  independent investment bank that has advised on many of the  year's big deals. Yet more than anything, it is the sense of relative  stability that has unleashed Wall Street's deal makers. And until  that changes — in the form of a stock market crash or  another debt crisis — the merger boom seems likely to  continue. ""This is another consistent piece of information that the  economy really is doing well right now,"" Ms. Sinclair, the  economics professor, said. ""But there's also reason to be  slightly concerned. When you see a bunch of deals all at once,  you wonder that if this is, once again, irrational  exuberance.""

"        Cramer: The lucrative journey of Allergan
			                 ",2014,11,17,"   The money making game all comes down to who is running a company.   Good management trickles down to a good investment. That is  why Jim Cramer knows that plenty of money can be made when there  is a terrific CEO who insists on good value.  Sometimes that value is brought out by hard work. Sometimes by  ingenuity, technology and inventiveness. Sometimes it is all of  these things combined, plus strong bargaining power.  ""With this $219 Actavis bid,  Allergan's David Pyott has  accomplished all of those things for shareholders,"" Cramer said.  On Monday Actavis announced it had agreed to pay $66 billion, or  $219 a share, for Botox maker Allergan. This is a landmark price,  considering it was just trading at $28 six years ago.  Cramer added that Pyott has done an amazing job putting some good  things in the pipeline for Allergan to make it so attractive.   He spent more money on research and development than any  other pharmaceutical company, which has paid off in the case of  Botox.    Allergan created new uses for the wonder drug—including a  ground breaking migraine drug that cuts the amount of times  people suffer from them, as well as putting a stop to overactive  bladders.    Other companies also attempted to bid for Allergan; however Pyott  stood his ground and insisted on the value of the company.   Low bids came in from Valeant, the predatory drug company known for buying  and stripping the research and development budget to bare bones.   Another low bid also came in from Bill Ackman, the rough and tough hedge fund manager.

But  now, sales at One57 may be coming back down to Earth.  The 1,004-foot tower looming over the southern edge of Central  Park held the title as the highest residential tower in New York until this month, when it was eclipsed by the 1,396-foot luxe tower 432 Park Ave. Some of the buzz around One57 sprung from reports that its two penthouses each sold for $90 million—said to be a record. The exterior of One57. Source: One57. Bill Ackman, the billionaire  hedge funder, told The New York Times that he and a group  of friends bought one of the penthouses ""just for  fun""—and for flipping.

Read MoreSecret mansion buyers hide behind  LLCs  According to public filings from One57's developer, the building  only sold two units in the entire first half of 2014. Yes, about  75 percent of the building's 92 units are sold, but at the  current sales rate, it would take more than six years to sell the  remaining units, according to Jonathan Miller, president and CEO  of appraisal company Miller Samuel.  And that's at a time when a half dozen other big condo  megaprojects are going up nearby, including 432 Park which boasts  higher floors.   Prices for new luxury developments in Manhattan fell 8 percent in  the third quarter, according to a report from real estate  management firm Douglas Elliman.

Miller retrieved the numbers he cited from debt-issuance  documents that Extell filed in Israel. He said Extell probably  wasn't expecting the numbers would find their way to the New York media  and take away some of the shine from the building's previously  glowing coverage.

Yet it's unclear what Ackman and his ""friends"" truly paid.  Several brokers said privately that they believe the purchase  price was less. The closing documents haven't been filed with the  city yet, and some of the closing prices in the building that  have been disclosed differ from the initial reported contract  amounts. It's also unclear what terms, considerations and trades  are included in the sales contracts.  Meanwhile, it's in everyone's interest to suggest a higher sale  price for the penthouse. Extell wants higher prices for other  units. Ackman and his group don't want potential buyers to know  how much they're making with the flip.   Of course, the $90 million price may be entirely accurate—and it  may sell for far more in the coming months or years.

"        Cramer: Activists are picking on the wrong chiefs

Right now there are three CEOs who are being called out by big  name activists and hedge funds for not doing enough for  shareholders—Tim Cook from Apple, David Pyott from Allergan and Indra Nooyi from PepsiCo—and the ""Mad Money"" host doesn't like it.  The most talked about catcall on Thursday was the letter from  Carl Icahn to Tim Cook, the Apple CEO. The letter from Icahn, first  posted on Twitter, said that while  Cook has done a fantastic job, there is so much more to do.   Icahn proposed that the tech giant make a tender offer to  get the stock rallying again, because he believes that Apple is  undervalued.    Cramer's take away from this is that Icahn believes that Cook is  not giving it all he's got. ""I only wish there were other CEOs as  shareholder friendly yet as strong in the creation, development  and execution of terrific products as Cook,"" Cramer said.  Nelson Peltz is calling for Nooyi to split PepsiCo into two units, dividing  beverage from snack foods, and then buy Mondelez to pick up the snack foods portion.   Cramer says that plan would have made sense when the stock  was in the $60's, but now it's in the $90's.    Now it is a star of the consumer packaged goods industry, and the  combination of the two units together is actually giving PepsiCo  an edge among its competitors. With General Mills, Kellogg, Conagra and Campbells all struggling, Cramer wondered why  Peltz is hounding the best?  Why not declare victory for  Nooyi and say thank you for a job well done?  ----------------------------------------------------------  Read more from Mad Money with Jim Cramer Cramer: Troubled charts mean stormy seas  ahead?

So what did Allergan do in exchange?  It has delivered  the best results out of any of the large pharmaceutical  companies.  Cramer thinks that CEO David Pyott has done more  than its competitors to create value for shareholders,  outrunning Merck, Pfizer, Bristol-Meyers and GlaxoSmithKline.  Activists should be telling Allergan's brass, ""We see you took  many of the actions we wanted and we are thrilled and that is why  we are going to go after a different company where the CEO isn't  as motivated to do the right thing,"" Cramer said.  At the end of the day, Cramer doesn't feel bad for these CEOs.  They are so well-compensated and live probably better lives than  everyone else in the country.  Given the wealth they have  created for shareholders, the ""Mad Money"" host thinks it is well  deserved.

			                 ",2014,09,30,"   The Securities and Exchange  Commission charged two men Tuesday with insider trading in  connection with Pershing Square's announcement that it had taken  a short position on Herbalife.  The SEC said Filip Szymik of New York learned from his  roommate, who was a Pershing  analyst, of William Ackman's planned announcement on Dec. 20, 2012, that he was shorting Herbalife stock because of his claim that its operations amounted to a pyramid scheme.Szymik, 28, then allegedly told Jordan  Peixoto of the news. Peixoto, 30, of  Toronto, in turn allegedly made $47,100 off of Herbalife put options, the agency said.Read MoreOpinion: It's time to  legalize insider trading ""Szymik and Peixoto chose to engage in illicit tipping and  trading in advance of the announcement of market-moving  information and today they are being held accountable for those  offenses,"" Sanjay Wadhwa, senior associate director of the SEC's  New York Regional Office, said in a statement.   The SEC said it settled with Szymik, ordering him to cease  and desist from further violations and pay a $47,100 civil  penalty.

"        Ackman to use dual share class for European IPO
			                 ",2014,09,15,"   Hedge fund activist Bill Ackman has never been shy about using his  shareholder rights to demand change from company management  teams. But as CEO of his own soon-to-be public company, he'll use  a dual share-class structure that has traditionally been  considered unfriendly to investors—albeit with a twist.  As part of the planned offering of Ackman's foreign offshoot,  Pershing Square Holdings, on the Euronext exchange in Amsterdam  in October, the company has created two sets of shares, say  people familiar with the company's prospectus: One that will be  sold to the public in Europe, and a second that will be  controlled by a nonprofit organization in Canada. The nonprofit's leaders, who will oversee a little more than 50  percent of the voting rights attached to the Pershing Square  Holdings stock overall, will be expected to side with shareholder  interests, say these people.  Dual-class share structures, which often bring with them enhanced  voting power for management and diminished influence for average  investors, have long come under fire by corporate governance  experts. Although standard fare at certain companies, including  news organizations—where editorial independence is thought  to be more important than profits—dual-class share  structures run the risk of entrenching ineffective management  teams, to the dismay of public investors. Read MoreAckman plans Amsterdam fund IPO  In the case of Pershing Square Holdings, the dual share class was  created to ensure that a majority of the company's voting rights  were located outside of the U.S.—a requirement if the company is  to continue charging its usual management fees, said the people  familiar with the matter. The entity that controls the majority  of the Pershing Square Holdings shares is a Canadian  breast-cancer charity unaffiliated with the investment firm or  with Ackman, these people said. Third Point Offshore, an offshoot  of the New York-based hedge fund company Third Point LLC that  went public in 2007 on the London Stock Exchange, adopted a  similar structure at that time, putting 40 percent of its voting  rights into an entity called VoteCo that was based on the island  of Guernsey. Read MoreLawmakers to press SEC on Ackman  ""They're doing something a bit creative, but it's still  insulating him from the accountability of the market,"" said Nell  Minow, a longtime corporate governance expert, of Ackman's  proposed structure for Pershing Square Holdings. ""There are  plenty of less intrusive steps that he could take to protect  himself from unscrupulous investors.""  Minow raised concerns about the notion of a nonprofit  organization, however independent, effectively controlling a  company like Pershing Square Holdings. ""In the past,"" she said,  ""it's not been a great thing for nonprofits to have control of  for-profit entities. They have different risk tolerance and  different accountability.""  As part of Monday morning's announcement that it would launch  what was expected to be a $5 billion offering on Oct. 13,  Pershing Square Holdings disclosed having already lined up early,  or ""cornerstone,"" investors who are buying $1.5 billion worth of  shares.   Nonetheless, other potential shareholders expressed mixed  feelings about the idea of investing alongside Ackman. They noted  that despite an impressive performance of more than 30 percent  returns so far for 2014—a figure that leaves nearly all the  company's competitors behind—the hedge fund manager had also  presided over big investment failures like J.C. Penney, which created nearly $500 million in losses  for Pershing Square, and expensive gambles like a bearish  position on Herbalife, which has  gone in and out of profitability for Pershing Square since its  inception in the spring of 2012, in the recent past. Read MoreAmid Alibaba fever, reasons for caution  in IPO market  During the course of multiple months, Pershing Square shorted, or  bet against, Herbalife at an average price of $48, said someone  familiar with the prospectus. So with the stock trading at about  $45 as of Monday, the hedge fund's position is in the black. —By CNBC's Kate Kelly",https://www.cnbc.com/2014/09/15/ackmans-european-offering-to-use-dual-share-structure.html
"        Stocks close down ahead of Fed meeting; energy hit
			                 ",2014,09,12,"   U.S. stocks closed down on Friday, breaking five weeks  of consecutive gains as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's announcement next Wednesday.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 closed  near 3-week lows, as energy led S&P declines for the week and the Dow  recovered slightly from an earlier 110-point drop on Exxon losses.   In addition to the impact of upcoming central bank news, most analysts said  stocks were reacting to being overbought in the last few weeks.  ""This is a market that's basing,"" Michael Gibbs, co-head of the  equity advisory group at Raymond James, said.  JJ Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade, attributed the  drop to ""repositioning"" and pointed out, as a ""good sign for the  market,"" that financials had held out pretty well during the day.  Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were two of just a few blue-chip  advancers, while financials declined the least among the  S&P's 10 sectors.  ""Part of it is rates rising, although maybe in the short term  [it] might hurt those involved with mortgages,"" he said. The rise  lets ""banks have a spread in borrowing, which they really haven't  had in a while."" Read MoreThis reg change would be huge for small  banks  Loren Mark Coffelt, co-portfolio manager of the Empiric 2500  Fund, was also bullish on financials.  ""They haven't played into a lot of the economic growth,"" he said,  noting strength in information technology stocks.  Next week, the Federal Reserve will meet and is expected to  announce details on quantitative easing and possibly interest  rates.  ""I think the markets are going to be watching [the Fed] very  closely,"" Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and  derivatives at Charles Schwab, said. ""The most likely catalyst  will be if the Fed changes that language next week, and I think  they will."" Read MoreWall street changing rates view  Much speculation has surrounded  the timing of Fed action on the interest rate, keeping  markets lower despite positive retail sales and consumer  sentiment reported on Friday.  ""The next FOMC meeting they're going to change the language  because the economy is self-sustaining—why do you need  interest rates at 0 percent? You've got a GDP rate of 4 percent  [and] strong corporate earnings,"" Douglas Cote, chief market  strategist for Voya Investment Management, said. ""Strong  economic growth is ultimately good for the markets, but in the  short term, rising rates are sending the market  lower.""   The yield on the 10-year Treasury note jumped to 2.61 percent on  Friday after beginning the week at 2.42 percent.  ""I think rates are going up because yields went down on a fear  factor because of geopolitical problems,"" Peter Cardillo, chief  market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, said. ""Now most of  those [fears] have weakened."" Read MoreThis could be the trade of the  decade  Businesses inventories rose in July, while the consumer sentiment index reported  preliminary September numbers above estimates and the highest in  more than a year.   Energy commodities continued to trade at lows.  ""Oil is a fear asset, gold is a fear asset, and they're all  coming down. The market is looking past the geopolitical risk,""  Cote said. ""Investors should take this as an opportunity to add  to fear assets.""  Earlier, low energy prices had boosted transports slightly, with  airlines leading gains.  ""I prefer to look at places where the energy drop is positive and  clearly it's the airlines, and I think also auto sales, which is  encouraging for other sales,"" Marc Chaikin of Chaikin Analytics  said.  The European Union implemented a new round of sanctions against Russia on Friday,  as did the United States,  placing restrictions on firms including Russia's largest bank,  several state-owned defense technology companies and five Russian  energy companies.  Wall Street had looked set to open narrowly lower on Friday on  this week's key U.S release—retail sales, which rose in-line with expectations in August at  0.6 percent.  ""I think consumer confidence and low energy prices are being  reflected in retail sales,"" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at  Wunderlich Securities, said.  Some rebound had been expected in August sales after July's  subdued reading of a 0.3 percent gain, with underlying spending  supported by the marked decline in gasoline prices.  Read MoreEveryone loves Alibaba, demand  soaring: Sources  ""Bottom line, retail sales remain good but not great,"" Peter  Boockvar, chief market analyst at The Lindsey Group, said in a  note.  Separately, the Labor Department reported the biggest drop in nine months for  U.S. import prices, which fell in August, matching  expectations.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 61.4 points, or 0.36 percent, at 16,987.51.  The  was down 11.9 points, or 0.60 percent, at 1,985.54, with energy and utilities the hardest hit as all 10 sectors closed in the red.  The Nasdaq closed 24.2 points lower, or 0.53 percent, at 4,567.60.    The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), widely  considered the best gauge of fear in the market, traded near 13.5.  For every advancer, four declined on the New York Stock Exchange  in the close, with an exchange volume of 672 million, and  composite volume of 3.1 billion.

""Mr. Ackman's hyperbole, bluster and personal attacks do not  change the fact that Valeant's offer is grossly inadequate and  substantially undervalues Allergan.

"        Valeant’s deal with Ackman: Too clever to be legal?
			                 ",2014,08,05,"   Tiptoeing on a tightrope past insider trading laws may be deft  and clever, but it doesn't make it right. For months, William A.  Ackman, the hedge fund manager, has nonchalantly said,  repeatedly, that his purchase of Allergan shares worth over $1 billion ahead of a takeover  offer from Valeant Pharmaceuticals  did not constitute insider trading. And, technically, he may be  correct.Read MoreAllergan suesAckman, Valeant, alleging insider trading Mr. Ackman had not been tipped off clandestinely. There was  no secret phone call or briefcase full of money. Instead,  Valeant's chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, called Mr. Ackman  directly and told him about his company's intent, seeking a  partnership of sorts in which Mr. Ackman would build a large  position in Allergan stock and help Valeant press Allergan's  board to acquiesce to a deal.  The tactic was certainly novel. It was the first time a company  had teamed up with an activist investor before a bid. Both Mr.  Ackman and Valeant said the arrangement was reviewed by an army  of lawyers, including Robert S. Khuzami, the former head of  enforcement at the Securities and  Exchange Commission, and was strictly within the law. Mr.  Ackman and Valeant — as a well as a number of spectators  — argued that the proposal adeptly skirted laws against  insider trading because, in this instance, Valeant's chief  executive, who would normally be considered the source of the tip  in this situation, did not breach any fiduciary duty because  Valeant was teaming up with Mr. Ackman as part of the takeover.  Some even heralded the move as the next big innovation in  activism. More from The New York Times:Graham Is Not Slowing Down After Sale of The Washington  Post Americans Are Bad at Math, but It's Not Too Late to  Fix Judge's Ruling Against Bank of America Showcases a Novel  EnforcementStrategy Still, something hasn't smelled right about these clever  machinations. An analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein quite rightly  titled a report ""How Can It Be Legal?"" Late last week, Allergan, the maker of Botox, offered an  argument for why the arrangement might not be legal after all.  Most important, even if it were legal, it clearly undermines the  public's confidence that all investors get to play on ""a level  playing field,"" the Bernstein analyst said. Allergan sued Valeant and Mr. Ackman, contending that they  did indeed engage in insider trading and that Mr. Ackman should  be forced to disgorge the shares he controls. While Mr. Pearson may not have breached a fiduciary duty to  Valeant by sharing information about the planned takeover bid  with Mr. Ackman — that's an S.E.C. rule known as 10b-5  — Allergan argues they violated another S.E.C. rule that  makes it illegal to share information before a takeover bid when  it is part of a tender offer, in which the suitor goes directly  to shareholders, bypassing the board. Valeant, after being  rejected by Allergan's board, began a tender offer for Allergan  on June 18. (If you're asking why the S.E.C. prevents one kind of  insider trading and not others, that's a good  question.)Read MoreI did not front-runAllergan stock, Ackman says At the time that Valeant first came forward with its bid,  those observers who said the maneuver was legal did so  specifically because the company and Mr. Ackman said they did not  plan to start a tender offer. But Mr. Pearson recently acknowledged, in an unscripted  moment during a conference call, that he anticipated pursuing a  tender offer from the outset. ""On April 22, we announced our  offer for Allergan. We suspected at the time it would ultimately  have to go directly to Allergan shareholders. We were  correct."" That runs counter to what the company said initially.  ""Valeant and Pershing Square went so far as to claim in writing  that they were not contemplating a tender offer — a feeble,  self-serving attempt to circumvent the insider trading rules  — yet then agreed in the same document on the procedures  each would follow if a tender offer were to occur,"" Allergan said  in its lawsuit, referring to Mr. Ackman's fund, Pershing Square  Capital Management. Of course, Valeant has long argued that it is impossible  for it or for Mr. Ackman to have been involved in insider trading  because they are effectively partners in the bid for Allergan.  They described themselves as ""co-bidders."" (People close to  Valeant also say that Mr. Pearson's unscripted words are being  misconstrued and that he wasn't referring to making a tender  offer, rather he was saying Valeant always planned to communicate  with Allergan shareholders.)  But the idea that Valeant and Pershing Square are co-bidders is  questionable: ""Mr. Ackman and the other Pershing Square entities  are together offering precisely zero to Allergan stockholders  — they are seeking to sell Allergan stock as Valeant seeks  to buy it. Ackman is not going to be a board member of Valeant,  will not otherwise be a control person of Valeant and is not  going to receive any business or asset of Allergan as a result of  the tender offer,"" Allergan argued in its suit.  The case will most likely rest on how a judge interprets the  S.E.C.'s arcane rule, known as 14e-3. That rule says, ""If any  person has taken a substantial step or steps to commence, or has  commenced, a tender offer"" it will be considered ""a fraudulent,  deceptive or manipulative act"" for ""any officer, director,  partner or employee or any other person acting on behalf of the  offering person or such issuer, to purchase or sell"" stock. Read MoreLawmaker to press SEC on Ackman's  Allergan tactics  Valeant and Mr. Ackman will inevitably argue that at the time  Pershing Square purchased the stock, they had not taken steps to  start a tender offer. Further, they will most likely contend that  they are protected by another arcane rule that allows purchases  of stock of a target company if it is done ""by a broker or by  another agent on behalf of an offering person."" In this case, the  offering person would be Valeant.  At the moment, neither Valeant nor Mr. Ackman is trying to argue  the merits of the case. Instead, Mr. Ackman, in a statement,  simply derided Allergan's lawsuit as ""a shameless attempt by  Allergan to delay the shareholders' fundamental right to call a  special meeting and vote their shares."" He said, ""This  scorched-earth approach is further evidence of the board's and  management's further entrenchment."" In truth, Allergan's  litigation may be as much about the law as it is a defensive  tactic.  Whatever the case, Valeant and Mr. Ackman's actions, at least  from a public policy perspective, may have been too clever by  half. When Sanford C. Bernstein wrote a note to clients at the  time the offer was first announced, it described Pershing Square  as having found an opportunity for ""regulatory arbitrage.""  Now a judge will decide whether it was truly regulatory arbitrage  or something more sinister.  Valeant and Mr. Ackman might benefit from reading a court  decision about another hedge fund, the Children's Investment  Fund, which lost a 2008 case to CSX in which it had secretly amassed a large  stake. The judge wrote: ""Some people deliberately go close to the  line dividing legal from illegal if they see a sufficient  opportunity for profit in doing so. A few cross that line and, if  caught, seek to justify their actions on the basis of formalistic  arguments even when it is apparent that they have defeated the  purpose of the law.""  —By CNBC anchor and New York Times reporter Andrew Ross  Sorkin",https://www.cnbc.com/2014/08/05/valeants-deal-with-ackman-may-be-too-clever-to-be-legal.html

Rep. Edward Royce of California plans to grill SEC Corporation  Finance Director Keith Higgins at a House Financial Services  hearing.  Among his top concerns is a rule that lets investors such as Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management delay  publicly reporting when they have amassed a large stake in a  company for days.  ""I am especially interested in the SEC's process when looking at  novel or creative deals like the announced joint-bid by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Pershing Square  for Allergan,"" Royce said in a statement.

In recent months, Royce has been writing letters to the SEC to  express concerns about some unusual maneuvers that Ackman's  company has used in its joint  effort with Valeant Pharmaceuticals to win a $53 billion hostile  takeover of Allergan, which is headquartered near Royce's  California district.  In one May letter, Royce said he was concerned about early  efforts by Ackman to call a nonbinding shareholder vote outside  of Allergan's typical election procedures as a way to pressure  Allergan to negotiate a deal.Read MoreAllergan to shareholders: Ignore Pershing Square  Royce said he feared this ""shadow"" election would make it tough  for shareholders to ""truly understand what is going on.""  Pershing Square dropped plans for a shareholder referendum in May  and has since pursued a more traditional proxy battle.  In a July 2 letter to Royce, SEC Chair Mary Jo White said that the Corporation Finance  division will ""continue to consider issues raised by the filing  related to the abandoned shareholder referendum"" and ""issues  raised by any future filings of a similar nature.""  Ackman's tactics have raised a number of regulatory questions,  both about his actions and about hostile takeover bids generally.

"        Here's how much Ackman lost during Herbalife talk
			                 ",2014,07,23,"   After sinking as Bill Ackman  promised CNBC viewers he would deal a ""death blow"" to the  company, Herbalife shares surged  during his actual presentation. And that may have cost the head  of Pershing Square Capital Management up to $70 million in paper  losses on Herbalife options alone.  Ackman's position in Herbalife is often referred to as a short  position, but at this point, it is just as much an options  position. In October, the fund manager announced that he was  converting 40 percent of his $1 billion short position into  long-term put options. Puts, which grant their owner the right  (but not the obligation) to sell shares for a given price at a  given time, rise in value as a stock falls. Read MoreFormer Herbalife analyst accuses Bill  Ackman of lying during presentationAs a stock rises, however, the price of put options plummets.  While Ackman has never laid out the details of his options  positions, many derivatives experts say he likely owns the vast  majority of the 50-strike, 60-strike, and 65-strike Herbalife  options that expire in January. And on Tuesday, those options  lost as much as $70 million on paper, all-told. The greatest percentage loss  was in the January 65-strike puts, which lost more than 40  percent of their value in one session. Multiplying that $7 loss  by the open interest of 30,000, the combined holders of that  option alone lost more than $20 million just on that line of  options.""Are these options all owned by Ackman? Probably not, buy I'm  guessing a good percentage of them are,"" commented options expert  Michael Khouw of Dash Financial.  Now, most of the options that Ackman is actually holding are  likely not publicly traded—he announced in October that he  was buying over-the-counter put options, meaning that they were  privately negotiated. However, the seller of those options likely  went out into the options market to buy puts in order to hedge  their risk. That would explain the strongly elevated open  interest in the Herbalife put options. And regardless of the  specific terms of the over-the-counter deal, the decline in  prices clearly indicate that Ackman's position has lost a good  deal of value.Read More  Ackman clients shrug off failed Herbalife 'death blow'  In fact, in response to Ackman's presentation on Tuesday, a day  after his CNBC appearance, Herbalife directly referred to those  January options.

Read MoreHerbalife: Ackman 'Worst of Wall  Street'  The Pershing Square Capital Management founder's presentation  focused on the supplement company's nutrition clubs, which  he said were ""mini"" versions of the multilevel marketer's broader  ""pyramid"" scheme.  Ackman cited findings by his undercover investigators who joined  Herbalife's nutrition clubs. The  presentation purported to show evidence that the clubs,  such as those under the ""Club 100"" umbrella, are designed to  recruit and train additional product-selling members, as opposed  to consumption of the company's shakes and other products as is  suggested by Herbalife.  ""This is a mini-Herbalife pyramid,"" Ackman said of Club 100 and  its own structure of recruiting new members, especially family  and friends. ""They are not selling weight loss in these clubs,  they are selling a business opportunity,"" he said.  Ackman called the labor provided to Club 100s by recruits ""free""  and ""illegal."" He noted that to ""graduate"" from a Club 100, you  first had to recruit 10 other members as part of a certification  program.  Ackman said that 40 to 50 percent of Herbalife's revenue comes  from nutrition clubs, higher than the company estimates. He said  the entire company would eventually collapse because most of  those club sales are from selling to new recruits or to meet club  requirements and are not for actual consumption.  Read MoreAckman: Why Herbalife will  collapse  ""Mr. Ackman's claim about the earnings of Herbalife  nutrition clubs is completely false and fabricated,"" the company  said in a statement responding to the presentation. ""In fact,  according to a recent study commission by the Company, 87.5  percent of nutrition club operators feel good about the money  they earn and 92 percent want to continue with their club.""  ""Club 100 was a program that contained many of the best elements  of nutrition clubs, including education, mentoring and  fiscal responsibility,"" Herbalife added. ""These elements are the  cornerstone of our clubs today.Herbalife is proud of our members  who use nutrition clubs as an important tool of social support to  achieve good nutrition and a healthy active lifestyle.""  The Club 100 investigation was led by private  researcher Christine Richard, a former Bloomberg News  reporter who wrote ""Confidence Game,"" a book chronicling Ackman's  successful short bet against MBIA. She said she estimated that  the average Club 100 trainee spends $3,000 on shakes for family  and friends as part of the institutionalized recruitment  process. One part of the presentation focused on what Ackman said were  false income claims. In one undercover recording of a Club 100  event, an Herbalife promoter is heard implying that members could  earn as much as $657,000 a year.   Ackman cited internal Herbalife documents that described a  strategy to expand in developing countries, like Burundi and  Mexico, and to target Latinos in the U.S. He said the company  works to attract—and mislead—the ""poorest of the poor.""  Ackman addressed the stock's move up Tuesday by saying that  Herbalife shares routinely move up during bad news. He suggested  regulators examine if Herbalfe was buying back stock during  negative events to prop up its value. Ackman spoke following an appearance on CNBC by Herbalife  CFO John DeSimone earlier in the morning. ""His bark is always  worse than his bite,"" DeSimone said.  DeSimone appeared on ""Squawk  on the Street"" to rebut charges Ackman has made about  the multilevel marketing company, saying that the hedge fund  manager's claims of fraud were ""outrageous."" He staunchly  defended Herbalife's product and business model, even as  regulators probe the company.  ""There's no doubt he's missing the real analysis, the real  research,"" DeSimone said. ""What he's missing is that  fundamentally millions of people use the product and enjoy the  product.""On Herbalife's 5,000 nutrition clubs—the focus on Ackman's  latest presenation—DeSimone said they were benign ""social  gatherings"" to encourage use of the product.

"        For activist investors, a wide reporting window
			                 ",2014,05,20,"   William A. Ackman seemingly appeared out of nowhere.  It was only a month ago that David E. I. Pyott, chief executive  of Allergan, learned that Mr. Ackman's firm, Pershing Square  Capital Management, had amassed a 9.7 percent stake in his  company and become its largest shareholder as part of a takeover  effort with a rival, Valeant Pharmaceuticals.  Back in February, Valeant had approached Mr. Pyott about buying  his company, the maker of Botox, but he rejected the overture.  Little did Mr. Pyott know that Mr. Ackman had started racing to  buy up Allergan's stock that very month. While Mr. Ackman had  bought enough shares by early April to breach the 5 percent  threshold that requires a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, investors have 10  calendar days to make such a filing — and Mr. Ackman used  the window to accumulate even more shares as quickly as he could.  Mr. Pyott wasn't the only one blindsided. Investors were stunned,  too. How was it possible that Mr. Ackman had become Allergan's  largest shareholder without anyone knowing?

Gallagher  That question, and a spate of other similar secret buying sprees,  is prompting renewed questions about whether a disclosure rule  developed back in 1968, when investors would run across the floor  of the New York Stock Exchange with tickets in hand, is outdated  and whether the current rule is becoming just another example of  the way the markets appear rigged against the ordinary investor.  (I am leaving aside the discussion about the potential for abuse  when a company teams up with a hedge fund.)  ""These issues are part of a growing debate as to whether there  are cases of 'illegitimate' imbalances of information beyond  classic 'insider trading' that regulators should address,"" Victor  I. Lewkow, a partner at Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton,  wrote in a note to his clients.  In an age of activism, corporations are acutely focused on the  rule, arguing that the 10-day period gives large investors an  unfair advantage to accumulate shares without the requisite  disclosure — and, of course, that it puts companies at a  disadvantage to ward off unwanted suitors. Read More Activist Ackman  says Allergan CEO has conflict over letting go  But there is a larger issue for everyday investors.  When activists finally disclose the investment, it often moves  the market, according to Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz,  which has campaigned for years to change the rule on behalf of  its corporate clients. ""This delivers outsized returns to the  activist and those they tip, while injuring investors who are  deprived of the same knowledge,"" the firm said in a memo to  clients in March. (I first wrote about this issue four years  ago.) ""In an era of high-frequency trading, the 10-day reporting  window,"" it added, ""simply makes no sense.""  Indeed, the rule, which was established by the Williams Act in  1968, seems out of step for our modern times when transparency  and disclosure have become a key tenet of our markets. In  Britain, investors must disclose stakes of more than 5 percent  within two days; in Hong Kong, it is three; in Germany, it is  ""immediately,"" but no later than four days.Read More  The real Ackman and Icahn—scary  Activist investors counter that the 10-day period allows them to  take big stakes without tipping off other investors who would  invariably drive the price higher, giving them a financial  incentive to pursue investments, which they argue is in the  public good.  The question of whether activists promote the public good remains  open. Some research has suggested that activists have created  long-term value, while investors like Charlie Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, recently declared, ""I don't think  it's good for America.""  Mr. Ackman thinks the law should change — but in the other  direction. In an interview, he proposed that investors should be  allowed to buy up to 15 percent of a company before having to  disclose it. ""Control doesn't change at 5 percent or 10 percent  or 15 percent; 15 percent is a meaningful stake. But if the rest  of the shareholders don't agree with you, you're toast.""  He said that activists must be able to acquire big stakes  secretly or it becomes too costly to mount campaigns against  management. ""Shareholder activism is extremely time-consuming,  expensive and a drain on an investment firm's resources,"" he  said. More important, he argued, ""it is a good thing for a large  shareholder to be looking out for the other shareholders. A world  in which every shareholder is forced to be passive is Japan."" Read More This is the  stockpicker who beat Ackman & Einhorn  Whatever the case, activists — and other investors —  have long sought to keep their investments secret until just the  right moment, worried that a leak would cause the target stock to  jump, making their investment too expensive.  Not only have some investors used the 10-day rule to buy up  shares on the sly, but they also have also sought special  dispensation from the S.E.C. to make investments confidentially,  without any disclosure for long periods.  For example, David Einhorn argued for confidential treatment of  his investment in Micron  Technology. ""Mirror trading by 'copycats' could lead to  unwarranted volatility and inflated prices in the security,"" a  representative for Mr. Einhorn's firm, Greenlight Capital, argued  in a Nov. 14, 2013, letter, which my colleague, Matthew  Goldstein, wrote about this month. Read More Ackman and  Valeant plot 'not fair': Gabelli Warren E. Buffett, Carl C. Icahn, Mr. Ackman have all taken  advantage of the confidentiality rule.

Strine Jr., the former chief judge  of the Delaware Court of Chancery, the nation's top business  court, agrees that some reform is needed.

Specifically, Judge Strine added: ""Precisely how 'long' the  fund's investment in the company is and in what manner the hedge  fund is long is relevant information for the electorate to  consider in evaluating the hedge fund's interest.

			                 ",2014,05,15,"   Renowned short-seller Jim Chanos said Thursday he'd continue to  bet against Caterpillar and China.  Speaking from the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, the Kynikos Associates founder revealed his theses behind selling  short several high-profile stocks on CNBC's ""Halftime Report.""  ""I think people are generally of a belief that this is a North  American construction play. It's 15 percent of their business,""  he said. ""Maybe it's an oil and gas play. Caterpillar is a very  diverse company. A big part of their profits are in mining, which  continues to decline. The stock is trading above a market  multiple for a cyclical company, where even the management has  said they think trough earnings could be $3.50. We don't get it.""Read MoreMichael Novogratz touts bitcoin, M&A and tech  Chanos, who has said considered his Caterpillar short his best  investment idea of 2013, also noted that the value of mined  commodities, such as coal and iron, keep dropping.  China, which has been another favored short for Chanos, was also  looking up from a short perspective because of its crackdown on  corruption. Most recently, a GlaxoSmithKline executive was  charged with bribing hospitals and doctors.  ""And the two areas that I think are feeling it right now are  luxury goods and real estate. It's one of the reasons real estate  transactions have collapsed in China this year,"" he said. ""The  next two are flight capital in terms of foreign real estate and  art—Sotheby's—and Macau. We're getting increasingly  concerned that a crackdown's looming in Macau.""  Chanos, who was speaking from the Bellagio Hotel, demurred when  asked to expand on his comments. Read MoreNouriel Roubini and Peter Schiff duke  it out—again  ""No comment on what we're shorting in Macau. I'm sitting in a  casino if you haven't noticed,"" he said, adding that he was  ""worried"" that U.S. operators were facing real risks from the  corruption crackdown.  ""We were long corruption, short property in 2010-11,"" Chanos  said. ""We would no longer be long the Macau casinos.""  In a week that saw record prices at a — including the sale of ""Popeye,"" a  six-and-a-half-foot-tall Jeff Koons sculpture  to casino  magnate Steve Wynn for $28.1 million—Chanos saw a clear  sign.  ""Usually, when the art market starts to get silly, it's time to  be out of Sotheby's,"" he said.Read More  Chanos downplayed the proxy fight between Sotheby's and Third  Point's Dan Loeb, who gained three seats on the company's board  and upped his stake to 15 percent. ""You can get too wrapped up in  personalities and not the actual fundamentals of the company,"" he  said. ""What really concerns us is that an awful lot of the action  right now is not in artists who are dead, to be blunt. It's in  young artists who are still producing a lot of art, and at these  prices will produce even more of it.""  Chanos also took a short position in Valeant, which has made an unsolicited bid for Botox  makerAllergan, in which Chanos has a long position.  ""We're short because it's a roll-up, and roll-ups a unique set of  problems,"" he said. ""Roll-ups are generally accounting-driven,  and we certainly think that's the case in Valeant. We think that  Valeant is playing some very aggressive accounting games when  they buy companies, write down the assets. … And finally,  the only people who are more negative about Valeant than maybe me  are Valeant insiders.""  Chanos noted that six executives have left in the past 15 months,  as well as selling by insiders, including the executive  vice-president of corporate and business development.  ""I mean, there seems to be not a lot of confidence from inside  the Valeant executive suite here,"" he said. ""And that's putting  aside the deal dynamics, which is a whole separate story.""  Chanos said his short position had little to do with pressure  from Allergan shareholder Bill Ackman of Pershing Square to  accept Valeant's acquisition bid.  Chanos was also short Keurig Green Mountain and SodaStream, while being long Starbucks.  ""Basically, Green Mountain's core business has been slowing for a  while,"" he said. ""They had to do a transformational deal. They've  done it. I'm not so sure that single-serve cold products are the  next wave. I mean, I have carbonated, single-serve cold beverages  in my refrigerator, in cans.""  Chanos said that insider selling provided support to his  reasoning.  ""We are seeing a ton of Green Mountain insiders in the last two  months unloading stock, the majority of their stock, in many  cases,"" he said. ""The head of U.S. marketing just sold a majority  of their stock this week. And so, again, you don't have to listen  to a short-seller. Look at the executive suite.""  Chanos, who had been long FireEye and short Symantec — and profited from both trades,  noted that valuations set on small floats were difficult to  maintain.  Meanwhile, stocks such as those of Tesla and Netflix were a different story.  ""I think both of those are instances where the floats are  probably going to continue to increase,"" Chanos said. ""Suffice it  to say, I think any stock that is trading in the tens of billions  of dollars and being valued on 2020 estimates is pretty much on  our radar, and I'll leave it at that.""    —By CNBC's Bruno J.

Allergan, which makes popular anti-wrinkle treatment Botox,  said it believed Valeant's business model was  not sustainable and that the offer was too  risky because of this uncertainty about the  company's long-term growth. Read MoreI did not front-run Allergan stock,  Ackman says ""Valeant's model of cutting and slashing really doesn't  work for more than a very short period of  time,"" Allergan Chief Executive Officer David  Pyott said during a conference call with investors to explain  the move. He said Valeant's billions of dollars in cost cuts would  prevent Allergan from delivering growth that it  could produce on its own, and he set a target  of a 20 percent to 25 percent increase in earnings  per share in 2015. Valeant and activist investor Bill Ackman, who has a stake of almost  10 percent in Allergan, made an unsolicited  cash and stock offer for the company in  April. Read MoreM&A fever – the coming  epidemic Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said the company was  disappointed that Allergan has rejected the  offer and that it remained committed to the  transaction. Ackman did not have an immediate response. Allergan had said it was considering the offer, but within  days, it adopted a so-called poison pill  provision to slow a takeover. If Ackman's  Pershing Capital raises its stake beyond the 10  percent threshold, other investors could buy  discounted shares.   Allergan has also been seeking other buyers such as  Shire, according to sources familiar with the matter.  Pyott said during the call that external moves were options, ""but  it would be totally premature to discuss them.""  He also said he was watching the national debate about companies  that move their tax bases outside the United States and that  he expected changes to U.S. tax rules.

Valeant Chief Financial Officer Howard Schiller said last week  that Allergan spent too much on research and development and  that its selling, general and administrative expenses were  excessive.  Valeant said in announcing its April 22 bid for Allergan that  it expected at least $2.7 billion in annual cost cuts.  Allergan said on Monday that it expected to increase its earnings  per share by 20 percent to 25 percent in 2015.  The company also forecast double-digit sales increases and  annual compound growth in earnings per share of 20 percent  over the next five years, helped by recent and expected drug  approvals.

BMO Capital Markets analyst David Maris said he believed  Allergan's response will pressure Valeant to detail why its  offer will not hurt shareholders.  ""We remain of the belief that it is less than 50 percent likely  that Allergan is acquired by Valeant,"" Maris said in a  research note.   Valeant shares have risen 4 percent since announcing the offer,  while Allergan shares have gained nearly 14 percent.

"        Investor pressure pushing drugmaker M&A deals
			                 ",2014,04,23,"   Drugmakers eager to satisfy shareholders by boosting profits and  share prices are wheeling, dealing and in one case even making  trades like a pro sports team looking to shake up its roster. The  moves could spur more mergers and acquisitions in the industry.  Swiss drugmaker Novartis on Tuesday said it's trading its vaccine  business for GlaxoSmithKline's cancer drug business and  selling its veterinary drug business to Eli Lilly. Meanwhile,  Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals International.  said it teamed up with activist investor Bill Ackman in a bid for  Botox maker Allergan that could be worth about $45 billion.Read More  Pharma M&A is back-Can it cure the sector's ills?  Amid easier financing and low interest rates, four smaller  drugmakers also have announced bids of $3 billion or more to  acquire competitors since January, according to data and research  firm The Mergermarket Group. The biggest is a $23 billion bid by  Forest Laboratories for Actavis.  The deals partly reflect a push by the pharmaceutical industry to  boost sales and cut costs as drugmakers look for ways to return  to the growth investors have come to expect after the bullish  last two decades, when they continually churned out new  blockbusters, drugs with annual sales of more than a billion  dollars.  Most drugmakers have since seen revenue flatline or even dip as a  tidal wave of cheaper generic competition to former blockbuster  pills over the past few years wiped out billions of dollars in  annual revenue. Others see the wave coming—Novartis, for  instance, it is awaiting generic competition to its blockbuster  blood-pressure drug Diovan—and are trying to lessen the impact.  At the same time, research to develop new medicines to replace  lost income is ever more difficult and expensive. Mergers and  acquisitions give them additional sources of revenue and new ways  to cut costs and become more efficient while they wait for drugs  in their research pipeline to win approval. Read More  Why cancer drug newcomer GSK is getting out: CEO  Most of the spurt of mergers and acquisitions are meant to narrow  the drugmaker's focus, a strategy that's in vogue now, partly due  to pressure from analysts and investors. The pharmaceutical  industry tends to cycle back and forth every several years  between periods where most companies are divesting to focus on  their core areas, or diversifying by snapping up other types of  drugs or related businesses.  ""Wall Street has been rewarding more-focused companies"" with  higher share prices, said Les Funtleyder, a consulting partner at  healthcare investing firm BlueCloud Healthcare. ""You see one  company doing something and others feel like they have to make a  strategic response.""  Eric Gordon, an analyst and professor at the University of  Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the industry is  rearranging, with companies reducing the number of diseases  they're attacking and divesting noncore businesses to others  stronger in those fields.  ""A few years ago, it would have been the opposite. They were  acquiring things so they wouldn't be so dependent on one area"" or  drug, Gordon said. Then ""that doesn't do the magic that's  expected of it, so we divest and get focused. In 2019, we'll  probably be conglomerating again.""  In the short run, analysts say the deals will boost drugmakers'  share prices and guarantee yet another round of layoffs in the  industry. The layoffs, plus other synergies as the new assets are  integrated, should boost profit margins in the midterm.Read More  Meanwhile, patients ""waiting for a cure"" won't see benefits soon,  but might eventually, Gordon said. That's because rejiggered  companies with strong scientific teams and commitment to a  particular disease area could be less likely to scrap  experimental drugs in that field when they run into some bumps  during patient testing. On the other hand, the companies may  decide to reduce the number of experimental drugs they push  through increasingly expensive stages of patient testing.  ""There is that danger,"" Gordon warned.  —By The Associated Press",https://www.cnbc.com/2014/04/23/investor-pressure-pushing-drugmaker-ma-deals.html

"        Ackman break even on Herbalife? Don't bet on it
			                 ",2014,03,25,"   Several recent reports suggest billionaire investor Bill Ackman has done the unthinkable: break even  on his Herbalife trade. But a closer look at the numbers  indicates Ackman is still in the red on one of the most closely  watched trades in Wall Street history.  The Herbalife saga started back in December 2012, when Ackman  announced that his hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital  Management, was betting against Herbalife by shorting more than  $1 billion worth of the company's shares.   Let's generously say that Ackman started shorting when the stock  was trading at $50 per share, which would mean that he shorted at  least 20 million shares. Then a bunch of rival billionaires took  contrasting views, Ackman brawled with Carl Icahn on CNBC and the  stock soon soared to $80 a share, costing Ackman millions in  paper losses—to say nothing of his bruised ego.  Fast forward to Oct. 2 , when Ackman cried the investment  equivalent of ""Uncle!"" and released a shareholder letter in which  he announced he reduced his short-equity position by 40 percent  by buying a bunch of ""over-the-counter put options.""  (For  those who haven't been watching ""Options Action,"" put options increase in value when a  stock falls).  Read More Ackman  takes aim at Herbalife for China dealings  This means that Ackman must have covered about 8 million shares  at around $75, which is roughly where the stock was trading  around the time of the letter. That would mean a loss of about  $200 million (8 million times $25). Keep that number in mind.  We'll revisit it later.  Now to the options part of Ackman's bearish trade.  In late January, a huge number of put contracts that expire in  2015 were bought. Ackman has never acknowledged that he was the  buyer of those puts, but many options experts point the finger in  the hedge fund manager's direction. Specifically, most of the buying activity  centered around put contracts that become valuable if Herbalife  falls below $65, $60 and $50 by the end of January 2015. There are currently about 230,000 Herbalife put contracts  that have been purchased in the January 2015 expiry. If Ackman  owned half of all the available put contracts that have been  sold, and he booked a profit of $10 per contract, a very generous  assumption given where Herbalife has been trading, he'd have a  profit on the options part of his trade of about $115 million.  Now to the stock portion of his bearish trade. He covered 8  million of his short, so assuming he hasn't increased or  decreased his position, he's still short about 12 million shares  of Herbalife at about $50. The stock is trading today for $53.  That's a paper loss of about $36 million.Read More  Ackman outspent by Herbalife in lobbying battle  So let's do the math one more time. He booked an initial loss of  $200 million by closing out a portion of his stock short.  He potentially has a paper gain from his options trade of $115  million. He still has $36 million in paper losses from the part  of his short that he did not yet close. That leaves a remaining  loss of about $121 million.   ""It's almost impossible that Ackman scratched on this trade,""  commented Mike Khouw of Dash  Financial.

"        Big investors join activists in battle for control
			                 ",2014,03,19,"   For ages, institutional investors like mutual funds and pension  funds were content to take stakes in public companies, trust  their managements and bet on long-term gains. Companies trusted  that these investors would be passive shareholders and not rock  the boat.  The abrupt rise and increasing success of activist investors,  however, are forcing big money managers like BlackRock, T. Rowe  Price and Vanguard to question these long-held assumptions.  Mutual funds and other big money managers, which now control a  record share of public company stock, are working with activist  hedge funds behind the scenes, pressing for change at  underperforming companies in their portfolios and lending their  support to calls for management shake-ups. In some cases, the  institutional investors are even stepping out from the shadows to  pick their own fights.  ""This is the biggest shift in the battle for corporate control  since private equity was invented in the 1980s,"" said James  Rossman, head of corporate preparedness at Lazard. ""Activists  realize they can influence this concentrated shareholder base at  many companies, and they're tapping into the desires of  shareholders to see change take place.""  It is now common to see institutional investors support activist  campaigns. T. Rowe Price backed Carl  C. Icahn's opposition to the leveraged buyout of Dell last  year. Southeastern Asset Management, which worked with Mr. Icahn  on a rival bid for Dell, also quietly supported the Barington  Capital Group's campaign for change at the retailer Dillard's.  But traditional investors are not simply supporting activists  once a campaign has begun. They are constantly discussing a  variety of companies, and in some cases, the institutional  investors are even giving ideas to the activists.  ""Periodically, we are approached by large institutions who are  disappointed with the performance of companies they are invested  in to see if we would be interested in playing an active role in  effectuating change,"" said William A.  Ackman, founder of the $13 billion hedge fund Pershing Square  Capital, who is best known for his positions on J.C. Penney and Herbalife. Institutional investors even have an informal  term for this: R.F.A., or request for activist.  Several factors are contributing to the more robust dialogue  between traditional investors and activists. Many activist hedge  funds have outperformed traditional index funds in recent years,  emboldening activists and causing traditional money managers to  take note.  (Read more: SALT hedge fund event  considers new venue)  Rishi Bajaj of Altai Capital, a hedge fund that oversees $400  million, pointed to his firm's work at SunEdison, a solar power company. Altai took a board seat  in late 2012 and began working more closely with management.  Since the hedge fund first became involved in mid-2012, shares of  SunEdison have jumped 970 percent, and the company now has a  market value of $4.9 billion.  Though data tracking the success of activist campaigns is  imprecise, hedge funds that pursued a proxy fight to its  conclusion won 20.7 percent of the time last year, according to  FactSet. That is up from 9.5 percent in 2012 and 7.4 percent in  2011.  Activists may have also done themselves a favor by cleaning up  their image. Many prominent agitators no longer issue the  management-bashing poison-pen letters that once characterized the  industry. Even Daniel S. Loeb,  who made eviscerating company executives by letter into something  of an art form, has been more sparing in his use of the tactic.  He repeatedly had kind words for Sony when he sought to persuade  it to partly spin off its entertainment arm, avoiding an all-out  brawl.  ""I think activists in a lot of ways have been given a bad rap  because some used to lob insults from afar,"" Mr. Bajaj said. ""I  do think activism is becoming more and more intelligent."" More from The New York Times:If not a Cold War, a return to a chilly  rivalryGM chief steps up to handle safety  questionsNew social app has juicy posts, all  anonymous  Many institutional investors concur, adding that dialogue with  activists has increased markedly over the last year.  ""The key thing that's changed is that more mainstream investors  are willing to give an audience to activists,"" said an executive  at one large institutional investor. ""In part, that's because the  activists have become more sophisticated in how they present  their arguments.""  And what was once a knee-jerk reaction by many institutional  investors, who previously steered clear of activists, has  softened into something closer to collaboration.  ""We don't have a house view, whether pro-activist or  anti-activist,"" said Glenn Booraem, controller of the Vanguard  funds. ""We're pro long-term value creation.""  (Read more: Kyle Bass:  GM shares could touch $50)  The dialogue between activists and institutional investors often  begins even before a fight has gone public. Hedge funds want to  make sure that other big investors in a company share their views  before they take a big stake and press for change.  For example, before going public with its fight against Agrium,  the Canadian fertilizer company, the activist hedge fund Jana  Partners talked to several of the company's top investors in a  bid to gauge their support for its campaign to increase the share  price, including advocating the possible spinoff of the company's  retail agricultural division. Had other shareholders not  supported Jana's position, which was ultimately unsuccessful, the  fund was unlikely to have pursued it alone.  And when ValueAct, a relatively unpublicized activist hedge fund,  took a small stake in Microsoft last year, it did so knowing that  some of Microsoft's largest and oldest shareholders supported its  view that change was needed at the company. Though ValueAct had  bought less than 1 percent of Microsoft's stock, the company  granted the fund a board seat, recognizing that the hedge fund  was speaking for other investors, too.  (Read more: Big hedge fund money warns  about tech bubble)  Other activists contend that they hold only passing conversations  with shareholders of prospective targets, believing that  divulging information about their plans could spur a rise in the  companies' stocks, making an activist campaign significantly more  expensive.  Once campaigns are underway, both activists and companies seek to  enlist the support of institutional investors. After Mr. Icahn  took a stake in Transocean, he met with the company's big  investors at least six times before its annual meeting.  ""When contentious situations arise with companies in our  portfolios, we have always found it useful to hear perspectives  from both sides of the debate,"" said Donna F. Anderson, corporate  governance analyst at T. Rowe Price. ""This approach enables us to  make more fully informed decisions about the outcome that would  best serve the long-term interests of our clients.""  Much rarer, activists say, is a traditional money manager giving  a bomb-throwing hedge fund a specific target and goal. Another  hedge fund executive recalled hearing several years ago from a  portfolio manager at a big institution eager to force a sale of  Dobson Communications, a rural cellphone service provider.   The portfolio manager couldn't apply pressure directly on the  company, but he encouraged activists to take up the cause. It  isn't clear whether hedge funds complied, but Dobson eventually  sold itself to AT&T for $2.8  billion in the summer of 2007.  ""Institutional investors want to share the sick children in their  portfolio with someone who can help make them better,"" said Bruce  H. Goldfarb, chief executive of Okapi Partners, a proxy  solicitation firm.  In certain circles, T. Rowe Price, an institutional investor with  $614 billion in assets under management, has gained a reputation  for pursuing hedge funds and encouraging them to take up an  activist campaign. The firm denies it suggests certain targets  for activists but acknowledges it is in regular dialogue with  other investors about the companies in its portfolio.  At other big firms like BlackRock, which manages $4.3 trillion,  the lines are more blurred. BlackRock denies that any of its  portfolio managers pursue hedge funds with ideas, but some  portfolio managers are said to pass on certain ideas.  (Read more: Icahn's  eBay war: The Street vs Silicon Valley)  Many activist hedge fund managers are reluctant to publicly  acknowledge that they receive ideas from other investors, but  concede in private conversations that it is common practice to  discuss stock ideas with institutional investors.  One employee at a big New York hedge fund said that the exchange  of investment ideas between institutional investors and hedge  funds was typically more subtle. ""Shareholders talk to  shareholders,"" he said. ""In the course of ordinary conversation,  it comes up.""  With institutional investors now regularly supporting activists,  some are even taking the next step and effectively starting  activist campaigns of their own.  Last year, the California State Teachers' Retirement System,  which manages $176 billion, teamed up with the hedge fund  Relational Investors to undertake a campaign to split the Timken  Company into separate steel and industrial bearings  businesses.    Months later, the company agreed. Likewise, in 2011, the  Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan worked with Jana Partners to press  McGraw-Hill to spin off part of its business. McGraw-Hill  eventually broke itself apart, though company executives said at  the time that they had already been weighing a split by the time  Jana had arrived.  At some point, activists will not even be considered activists  anymore; they will just be thought of as ordinary investors, said  Michael Carr, head of Goldman Sachs's mergers and acquisitions  group in the Americas. Already, he said, ""the boundary between  long-only money managers and activists is starting to blur.""  —By David Gelles and Michael J. de la Merced  of The New York Times",https://www.cnbc.com/2014/03/19/new-alliances-in-battle-for-corporate-control.html

"        Bill Ackman losing lobbying war with Herbalife
			                 ",2014,03,10,"   Hedge fund manager William  Ackman, who is betting $1.16 billion that Herbalife is a fraud, spent $264,000 last year on  lobbyists to press his case against the company, according to  government documents filed in recent weeks.  That amount is dwarfed by the nearly $2 million Herbalife spent  in 2013 on federal lobbying as the nutrition and weight loss  company fought the billionaire investor's claims it runs a  pyramid scheme. In an illegal pyramid scheme members earn more  for recruiting new members into the scheme than for selling the  products outside the network.  Ackman's $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management hired  three lobbyists in 2013, marking the first time ever that the New  York-based hedge fund has spent money on Washington lobbyists,  data from the United States Senate Disclosure Act Database  show.  (Read more: Ackmantalks Herbalife, P&G, Target, Air Products)  In October, Ibarra Strategy Group began working for Pershing  Square and earned $30,000 for the year, the filing shows.  The group, founded by Mickey Ibarra, a former Director of  Intergovernmental Affairs under President Bill Clinton, specializes in Latino outreach.Commenting on a New York Times story about Pershing Square's lobbying efforts, Herbalife accused Ackman of running a ""cynical, self-serving attempt to manipulate the market by buying his way into an investigation to cover his own reckless $1 billion bet.""Pershing Square said Monday it plans a webcast on an investigation showing ""Herbalife's business in China operates much like the company's business in the rest of the world - as a pyramid scheme.""  Ackman has accused Herbalife of unfairly targeting minorities.  Civil rights group League of United Latin American Citizens,  which has asked California's Attorney General to probe Herbalife,  echoed the fund manager's accusations. Herbalife said last month  that it does not target members of minorities or low income  communities.  The battle for the future of Herbalife is heating up this year  with each side trying to press its case with Washington lawmakers  as well as regulators, who may ultimately control the company's  fate.  (Read more: Herbalife bet  ourworst ever: Pershing Square)  In the last days, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade  Commission refused to tell U.S. Senator Edward Markey, who asked  them to probe the company, what they were doing on Herbalife. But  each offered plenty of examples of having shut down illegal  businesses before.  SEC chair Mary Jo White, who last year touted the benefits of  shareholder activism, said the SEC's Enforcement Division has  previously probed whether statements made about a business are  ""materially false or misleading, including statements regarding  the compensation levels.""  Ackman has said that 88 percent of Herbalife distributors earn  nothing. That stands in stark contrast to some Herbalife  distributors' testimonials where they tout lavish lifestyles as  an incentive for others to sign up. Herbalife has said  distributors results' depend on time, energy and  dedication.  Ackman has forecast that Herbalife's share price will plummet to  zero amid regulators' scrutiny but so far the fund manager is in  the red on the bet, as Herbalife shares have climbed 61 percent  in the last year. Since January, the shares have lost ground  however, falling 17 percent.

			                 ",2014,02,13,"   Herbalife is now a ""levered pyramid  scheme"" because of new financing; Target has ""lost some of its magic;"" Procter & Gamble is a ""phenomenal business with  an enormous opportunity;"" and Air  Products and Chemicals will ""make a lot of money.""  Those are some of the views expressed Wednesday by hedge fund manager Bill  Ackman at a charity event in New York City.  The founder of $12 billion Pershing Square Capital Management  gave answers to a wide-ranging set of questions from members of  the audience at The Harbor Investment Conference, which also  featured Jonathan Gray of Blackstone  Group, Philip Hilal of Kingdon Capital Management, Stephen  Errico of Locust Wood Capital Advisers and others.  On Herbalife, Ackman weighed in on the multilevel marketing  company's recent round of financing, which included a stock buyback and debt offering. He  dismissed the move as just an addition to Herbalife's balance  sheet.  ""The company is now a levered pyramid scheme,"" Ackman said to  laughs. ""We like that.""

"        Huge trade suggests Ackman shorting more Herbalife
			                 ",2014,01,16,"    Is Bill Ackman adding to  his short bet against Herbalife?  That is what option experts are deducing after a massive bearish  bet against the stock was executed over two days this month.  Incredibly, even with Herbalife's 10 percent plunge on Thursday off a Chinese  investigation into fellow multilevel marketer Nu Skin, shares still need to drop another 40 percent  within a year to make the trade profitable at expiration.  (Read more: Nu Skin  stock tanks after Chinese investigation)  ""This was just a huge, huge bet to make, and the number of people  who could do that is really small,"" said option trader Mike Khouw, primary strategist at Dash  Financial. ""And Ackman has just enough hubris to do it.""  On Jan. 9 at 2:50 p.m. ET, 25,000 of the January 2015 50-strike  puts in Herbalife were bought for $7.25 each; at about the  same time on Jan. 10, 20,000 more were purchased for slightly  less.  Buying a put option is profitable only if the stock price falls  below the strike price of the put minus the money spent. In  total, this trade costs over $32 million and represents a bet  that Herbalife stock will fall below 42.75 by January 2015—a  50 percent decline from where the stock was trading.   The two-day trade was itself large enough to make the January  2015 50-strike put Herbalife's most-held option.   Traders say the trade's sheer size and nature limits the number  of investors who might have made such a play.   ""The long-dated, way-out-of-the-money puts could suggest that  Ackman is adding to the over-the-counter put position and the  dealer that sold it to him is hedging the position in the listed  market, or there is a new entrant on the bear case,"" commented  Dan Nathan, an options trader who  writes at RiskReversal.com.   Khouw said, ""When you start putting the pieces together—$33  million outlay, net of commissions of premium—who could? And  who would? But this fits Ackman's M.O. perfectly.""   (Read more: Ackman:  Herbalife's bad practices continue)  In an Oct. 2 letter, Ackman announced that he had converted more  than 40 percent of his short position on Herbalife into  ""long-term derivatives, principally over-the-counter put  options.""   It is conceivable, then, that Ackman might have bought more  over-the-counter options to perpetuate or increase his bearish  bet. And to hedge, the party that sold him those put options  would then be likely to buy listed options.  Calls made by CNBC to both Ackman and Pershing Square were not  returned by press time.  The trade has quickly become a winner on paper, with Thursday's  plunge in Herbalife shares bringing the value of the puts to  nearly $10. The shares came under pressure in sympathy with Nu  Skin, a similar company that Chinese newspaper called a  ""suspected illegal pyramid scheme"" (precisely the charge Ackman  levels at Herbalife) leading the Chinese government to announce  an investigation.  Still, when asked via email what could bring the stock all the  way down to $40, Herbalife analyst Tim Ramey offered a terse  response: ""No idea.""  Ramey, who has called Herbalife his top pick for 2014, followed  up by saying that in his estimation, shares wouldn't fall that  far even if the company's China business disappeared entirely.

"        Nu Skin stock tanks after Chinese investigation
			                 ",2014,01,16,"  Nu Skin shares plunged Thursday on  concerns over an investigation by Chinese authorities' into its  business practices in the country, a major source of its revenue.  Nu Skin stock was halted four times Thursday after plummeting 33 percent. (Click here to track the latest quote for the company's stock.)  The official Xinhua news agency said Thursday that China's State  Administration for Industry and Commerce had ordered an  investigation into Nu Skin. The move comes a day after the  state-run People's Daily published a story that likened Nu Skin's  coaching methods for salespeople to ""brain washing"" and  suggesting that it is a pyramid scheme.  Xinhua quoted a spokesman for the industry and commerce office  saying that authorities will take legal action if the  ""investigation results show the media reports were factual.""  Nu Skin, based in Provo, Utah, sells skin care and nutritional  products through a direct-selling model around the globe.  The company vehemently defended itself Wednesday, saying that the  People's Daily article contains ""inaccuracies and exaggerations  that are not representative of Nu Skin's business in China."" The  company said the reporters did not verify any of the information  with Nu Skin. It also said in a statement that the company is  ""dedicated to operating in full compliance with applicable  regulations as interpreted and enforced by the government of  China."" Nu Skin has worked in the country for 11 years.  Despite its defense, shares of Nu Skin plunged nearly 16 percent  Wednesday in high volume trading to close at $115.23.   (Read more: Nu  Skin shares shed 16% after China attack)  Canaccord Genuity analyst Scott Van Winkle cut his rating on the  company's stock to ""hold"" from ""buy"" on Thursday and decreased  his target price to $104 from $140 on concerns about risk in  China. The analyst said in a research note that the country  represents roughly one-third of the company's revenue for 2013 by  his estimates, making any upset in that market significant enough  to hurt its performance and stock value.""While we found yesterday's article to be the type of complaint  multi-level marketers often face, we believe that any government  investigation in China opens questions that we can't forecast,""  he wrote. ""Even with laws to provide a path, we don't  believe that anyone can predict the Chinese government in this  instance.""  The company is not the first to be hard hit by pyramid scheme  accusations.  Nutritional supplement maker Herbalife's shares lost about 40 percent of  their value in the days after hedge fund manager William Ackman accused it in 2012 of operating a  pyramid scheme, in which a company makes most of its money by  recruiting new salespeople, rather than on the products that they  sell.  Herbalife has repeatedly denied the claims and rival  investor Carl Icahn has disagreed as well, taking his  fight against Ackman public and increasing his stake in the  company.  The company's stock price later recovered and as of Wednesday's  close, its shares are up 76 percent in the past 12 months.
